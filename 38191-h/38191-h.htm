<h2>JOHN SMEATON.</h2>
<hr class="l6" />

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">People</span> who have been on a long sea voyage,
and have ended by sailing up the English
Channel, tell us how their hearts beat high, after
weary weeks and months at sea, when the cry
went up while as yet land was a mere shadowy
outline, &ldquo;The Eddystone in sight!&rdquo; For the
gleaming lighthouse standing immovable in the
midst of boiling waves and great mountains of
blinding white spray spells &ldquo;home&rdquo; to the
voyager.</p>

<p>To us the &ldquo;stone&rdquo; round which the waters
ceaselessly churn and &ldquo;eddy&rdquo; speaks of John
Smeaton, the man who built it. The great
engineer has been in his grave now for more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
a century, but his most lasting monument stood
for longer than that time firm as a rock.</p>

<p>John Smeaton was born in 1724, near Leeds.
Not the Leeds of to-day&mdash;a bustling, smoky
centre of manufacture&mdash;but a quaint little town
hemmed in by green country fields and lanes.
It was in one of these that Austhorpe Lodge
stood, the house of Smeaton&rsquo;s father, a lawyer
in Leeds.</p>

<p>We shall yet come across many boyhoods
tinged with shadow and struggle, and are not
sorry to find this one happy, fondly tended, and
bright with sunshine. There was no pinch in
the lot of the Smeatons, no grinding poverty
that we sometimes find to spur a boy to manhood
before his time. Little John was cradled,
as it were, in love. As a child his parents taught
him at home. He was not eager to mix with
other boys in outdoor romp or play, and very
early, while yet hardly more than a baby, he
showed a strong love for pulling his toys to
pieces to see what they were made of! Never
was he happier than when he could get hold of
a cutting-tool with which to shape toy pumps
and houses and windmills. Another amusement
of his babyhood was to divide squares and
circles!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>As a boy he was rather quiet and thoughtful,
though his tongue straightway loosed the moment
anything in the shape of a workman came to his
father&rsquo;s house. He was then always to be found
on the spot, and with eager eyes fixed on their
every movement, he would unconsciously &ldquo;pose&rdquo;
them with eager questions&mdash;such questions as
from the boyish lips made them shake their
heads and stare at him dumb and stupid.</p>

<p>And all the time the boyish brain was deeply
plotting, and it was ever that he might &ldquo;go and
do likewise.&rdquo; One day, after watching a millwright
at work, his anxious parents were alarmed
by the sight of their boy perched on the top of
the barn fastening a windmill to the roof! At
another time, when a pump was being made in
the village, by good luck a piece of bored lead
came in little John&rsquo;s way. He promptly set to
work and made a toy one after the pattern of
the big one, and even managed to make it raise
water.</p>

<p>But his greatest childish feat took place on
his discovering a fire-engine being erected at
a colliery in the village to pump the water out
of the mine. He was constantly on the spot,
eagerly watching it as it slowly progressed, and
quickly his boyish brain grasped the whole.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>He went home and began with trembling
fingers one day to copy it. His father had given
him an outhouse with bench and tools to carry
out his hobby, and soon the engine worked. He
looked round to see what he could use it upon,
and espied the fish-pond. So he began to pump
out the water till he had pumped the whole
place dry. When his father came home it was to
find an empty pond, and all his fish lying dead
at the bottom!</p>

<p>And now John had to leave his beloved workshop
for school in Leeds. And there it seemed
as if the boy showed up quite a different side
of himself. The bright, eager alertness that
marked him at home or with the workmen about
Austhorpe was gone. He was quiet with the
boys&mdash;out of his element. He did not care for
their rough play. He was like a fish out of
water. Silent, shy, even stupid&mdash;the boys nicknamed
him &ldquo;Fooley Smeaton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But though he might be dull at school, the
boy&rsquo;s real education was surely going on at home
among his pumps and model engines, his lathes
and chisels.</p>

<p>The boyish hands had begun to do that which
all through life threw over him a very spell of
fascination&mdash;<em>to construct</em>&mdash;to build up. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
baby fingers were learning how to use tools in
a way that was to give him one day, long years
after, a skill that would place him on the very
top of the ladder. And all the time the young
mind was pondering great mechanical principles
that were by-and-by to make the name of John
Smeaton famed throughout the world. So it
was not to games and boyish play that he gave
his spare moments, but to his workshop. When
he was fifteen he could use his turning-lathe to
turn wood and ivory. When he was eighteen
he could handle tools as deftly and cleverly as
any workman who all his life had known no
other trade.</p>

<p>When he was sixteen he left school and took
his place in his father&rsquo;s office, and tried to bring
his mind to look forward to law as his life-work.
He worked conscientiously day after day, coming
home at evening to spend half the night in
working&mdash;making&mdash;constructing things. He
had all the instincts of a born mechanic. It
was almost as if he could not help it.</p>

<p>When his father sent him to London to study
law, the boy tried again to stifle his longings,
and to set himself to carry out his father&rsquo;s
wishes. But strive and struggle as he would,
it was impossible to crush the desire of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
heart. And so one day he sat down and wrote
to his father that he could go on with law no
longer. Nothing except to be a mechanic would
satisfy him. His father, deeply disappointed
though he was, quietly made up his mind to
what could not be helped, and wrote to John
that he must make his own choice.</p>

<p>The boy was delighted. He had chosen what
was then the work of a common labourer, with
a labourer&rsquo;s wages. The term Civil Engineer
was unknown. With a heart beating high
with hope he went off and engaged himself
to a philosophical instrument-maker&mdash;a man
who made instruments for navigation and astronomy.
With him he worked steadily&mdash;eager
to improve the instruments&mdash;eager to improve
himself&mdash;so eager, indeed, that he divided out
his time so as to make the most of it: so much
for reading, so much for experiments, so much
for business, and so much for rest and relaxation.</p>

<p>And so on the threshold of manhood&mdash;having
got, as it were, &ldquo;a free hand&rdquo;&mdash;he made great
strides onward. He may not have done much
business at the time, but he read papers before
the Royal Society, and he kept open a keen,
mechanical eye for everything&mdash;from minute,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
delicate instruments to the building of canals
and bridges and waterworks. He thought no
trouble too great to take if so it made him
thorough. He set himself to study French and
Italian, so as to read the works in these languages
on mechanical subjects, and he even set off to
Holland&mdash;that land of dykes and harbours and
docks&mdash;that he might examine them for himself.</p>

<p>And while he looked about him, always at
the same time busy with the work that lay
nearest to his hand, the great work of his life
was drawing close to his door.</p>

<p>Many years before Smeaton lived, England
was in the custom of lighting up her rocky
headlands with lights or beacons. First came
&ldquo;the candle in the cottage window&rdquo; to light
the sailor husband home, then stacks of blazing
wood, piles of coal, oil, torches, pitch-pots.
Guided by these flaring lights in the darkness,
men and vessels plying round our coast were
saved from shipwreck and death. Sometimes
these beacons, flaming high from their pinnacles,
warned the people inland that war was expected,
the country was in danger of being invaded,
or that pirates were about to swoop down upon
them. At other times <em>false</em> lights were shown
by men known as &ldquo;wreckers,&rdquo; and homeward-bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
vessels, rich in goods and human souls,
were dashed upon the rocks. So our coasts
were lighted up in those old days, but it
happened at times that the pitch would become
drenched and drowned, the wood and coal fires
would spurt up for a space and then drop down
and fade. Things were uncertain. It did not
matter, perhaps, greatly, as long as England&rsquo;s
commerce by sea was small, but when our trade
with foreign lands began to grow, there grew,
too, the question how best to light our rocky
coasts and docks and headlands. So an order
of monks&mdash;the Brethren of Trinity House&mdash;was
made, and these prayed for the safety of
the sailors, and later looked to the lighting
of the coast.</p>

<p>Eddystone rock we can easily find on the
map, a low, black reef lying S.S.W. of Plymouth,
a place of lurking danger as well for ships cruising
up and down the Channel as for those coming
into Plymouth harbour. In the days of Smeaton,
and for some time earlier, the way in which lighthouses
were built was for a private man to go
to the owner and say, &ldquo;I will build a lighthouse
on that rock if you will let me.&rdquo; If his offer
were accepted and he carried out the work he
had then the right to levy dues on the ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
that passed, or, in other words, to make them
pay toll. In this way he sometimes collected
quite a large income.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the seventeenth century
a man called Winstanley undertook to build a
lighthouse on Eddystone. He drew out plans
and started on the work, and it was no light
work. The base of the rock was narrow and
sloping. It was hard to make the foundations
fast, for winds and waves had a way of rising
suddenly, and the whole of the work would be
drowned for the time, and perhaps many of the
materials swept away. But by dint of waiting
patiently for fine weather and smooth water the
building was at last finished. It was made of
wood, rather in an ornamental style, and had
many projections. It took four years in the
building, for although in other parts of the
Channel the waters might be smooth enough,
yet round the Eddystone they were almost sure
to seethe and foam. For several seasons the
building stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; exclaimed the builder one day,
elated that his work had turned out so well,
&ldquo;that I might be here in the fiercest storm, just
to see it stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After it had stood some three years from its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
finish Winstanley went out one day to see to
some repairs. He remained on the rock overnight,
and during the night his wish, though
hardly as he would have had it, was fulfilled.
A gale and storm terrific in their fury burst
overhead and broke along the English coast.
With the first streak of dawn an anxious people
looked from shore to see how it fared with the
lighthouse. Not a trace of it remained. Not a
speck was to be seen on the waters. It and its
maker had been utterly swept away!</p>

<p>Next came a man called Rudyerd, who volunteered
to build a lighthouse that would stand.
He pondered the last, and he came to the
conclusion that it had failed in form. He determined
to alter that. So he made a long,
high column in the shape of a cone, with no
ornaments, no projections jutting out to catch
the wind, and at the end of four years the thing
was finished&mdash;a wooden building coated over
with oakum and pitch.</p>

<p>For a time all went seemingly well. It held
four rooms, one above the other. The lantern
was lit by candles. Years went on, and still it
stood defying the winds and storms for half a
century. There were two light-keepers, who
snuffed the candles overnight, sitting up for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
four hours at a time. One of these men fell ill
and died. A storm was raging at the time. No
help could come to his companion, and so
through a long month he kept the body, afraid
to throw it into the sea, in case he should be
thought a murderer.</p>

<p>At last help came from shore, but the loneliness
and horror had told so terribly upon the
remaining man that ever afterwards three men
were employed to keep the light burning, in
case of one falling ill or dying.</p>

<p>But in spite of its long standing there was a
hidden flaw in the lighthouse. It was inflammable&mdash;capable
of catching fire. One day&mdash;no one
could quite tell how it happened, it might be
the flame had dried and scorched the timber. At
any rate, a man going in to snuff the candles
found that fire had broken out. It wanted but
a few minutes till the place was in flames. The
men rushed below, while a perfect rain of beams
and burning lead fell in showers about their
heads. Seeing the blaze from the shore a boat
put off with all speed. When it reached the
rock it found the men, not on the rock, but
crouching beneath a ledge, dripping and half
dead, and with just enough life in them to
enable them to catch the rope thrown to them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
for it was too rough for the boat to reach the
rock. And so they were towed on board.</p>

<p>And now the third attempt at the lighthouse
was to be made by John Smeaton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou art the man to do it,&rdquo; were the words
of the letter asking him to undertake the work.
And so Smeaton was launched on that which
was to make his name famous.</p>

<p>The first step he took was to get and study
the plans of the former men. To succeed he
had first to find out where the others had failed.</p>

<p>The first building had failed in weight. The
second had not been fire-proof. And so he
decided to make his lighthouse of stone. People
when they heard of it called out that it was a
wild project. It could not be done. &ldquo;Nothing
but wood could possibly stand on the Eddystone.&rdquo;
But Smeaton was in no way moved or
cast down. What he made he wanted to stand,
and not to last for a few years merely; and so
of stone he determined it should be.</p>

<p>He began to draw out the design. He kept
to the shape of Rudyerd&rsquo;s&mdash;the long cone-like
column. He made the diameter of the foundation
broader. He planned the locking and bonding
and dovetailing of the stones&mdash;each to each,
and all to the centre. When this was all carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
thought and made out he started from
London for Plymouth. He was <em>six days</em> on the
journey owing to the &ldquo;badness of the roads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the 2nd of April he set sail for the rock,
but winds and waves beat so vehemently that
he found it impossible to land. All he could
do was to view the low, treacherous black thing
on which he was to build his house of stone.
Back he went three days later, and for the first
time he stood on Eddystone, but only for a
couple of hours. There was almost nothing to
be seen, only one or two iron branches left from
the wrecks of the former wooden buildings. On
the third attempt he made he could not even
see the rock. Spray and foam hid it entirely
from view. In the same way his fourth and
fifth visits failed, but his sixth was successful,
and he landed at low water, and in the stillness
of the evening made his first measurements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went on with my business till nine in the
evening,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;having worked an hour by
candlelight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again and again he tried to get a landing.
Sometimes he managed it, at others it was
impossible. After having spent fifteen hours in
all on the rock he went back to London, and
with his own expert hands made a model. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
work took him two months in all, and that
proficiency that he had learned as a boy in his
little workshop at Austhorpe stood him in good
stead now. After this he set out for Plymouth
again. No detail of his work was too small for
him to attend to himself. He visited the
quarries where the stones were to be hewn. He
carefully chose the kind of cement that was to
bind them together; the workmen, the work-yards,
the ships that were to carry the stones
to the rock. Each and all passed under his
eye.</p>

<p>It was a great day when, in August, 1756, he
and his men started for Eddystone, and the
master fixed the centre and laid down the lines.
Now the work might be said to be fairly begun.
But was ever work so often broken in upon?
Winds and waves are not to be counted on&mdash;least
of all about the stormy Eddystone, for
often though the water is calm and smooth in
other places, it smothers in foam the low black
reef.</p>

<p>There were times when the workmen could
work as long as six hours at a stretch, going on
eagerly by torchlight if necessary. Again it
would happen they could not work more than
two hours out of the twenty-four. Time was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
precious, and time was grievously taken up in
going to and from Plymouth, and so Smeaton
arranged that a &ldquo;buss&rdquo;&mdash;a fishing-vessel with
two masts and a cabin at either end&mdash;should
ride at anchor near the scene of work, with provisions
and other necessaries.</p>

<p>But here, again, it was hard to plan ahead.
One day a mighty storm arose. The men could
not work. Their yawl broke from its moorings.
They could neither send to shore, nor could they
get help. But they must eat. Days passed,
and gradually their store of provisions grew less
and less. By the time relief reached them they
were at their last crust.</p>

<p>During the long months of winter when work
was out of the question the time was spent in
dressing the stones in the yard on shore.
Smeaton himself saw them laid out in lines
and numbered, after which they were put in
order on board ready to be lifted off when the
rock was reached, and easily put in their places.
Dangers and difficulties often crowded thick on
the work, enough to daunt a man less dauntless
than Smeaton. One night on the homeward
way a big storm arose.</p>

<p>The night was dark, and Smeaton was roused
from sleep by the sound of much stamping and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
hurrying to and fro overhead. He rushed on
deck in his nightshirt. The helmsman was
holding frantically by a rope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; he shouted when he saw
Smeaton and others, &ldquo;heave hard at that rope,
if you mean to save your lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Smeaton as well as the others laid hold.
In the pitchy darkness there fell on their horror-struck
ears the sound of waves breaking on the
<em>rocks</em>. The jibsail was blown to pieces. They
hastily lowered the mainsail. The waves
dashed over them. But gradually the ship
obeyed the straining helm and rounded off. In
anxious fear they lay out to sea. When morning
broke land was nowhere to be seen, and they
found themselves driving towards the Bay of
Biscay. For four long days they were tossed
and driven to and fro before they made Plymouth
harbour.</p>

<p>One day Smeaton had an accident, which, however,
might have been worse in its effects. He was
taking a turn up and down the narrow strip of
rock that was all that afforded a promenade when
his foot slipped and he fell among the rocks.
When he got up he thought himself unhurt till
a stinging pain informed him that he had dislocated
his thumb. He was hours from shore&mdash;far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
from a surgeon. Delay meant disablement.
So he took hold of it with his other hand,
pulled hard, and it snapped into place.</p>

<p>But in spite of danger and difficulty and
hindrance the great work went on, though slowly
still surely. By the end of the second year the
building had risen thirty-five feet high&mdash;out of
reach of the heavy dash and thud of the waves.
Gradually one above another rose the rooms for
the light-keepers&mdash;their walls twenty-six inches
thick to stand against the fearful onslaught of
the wind as it blew up the Channel from the
Atlantic. For in a gale the place shook and the
doors slammed and the windows rattled with
such terrific force that the new and unaccustomed
keepers earnestly wished themselves at Land&rsquo;s
End or anywhere else, so that it meant land.</p>

<p>To say that as it neared the finish it was much
in the great builder&rsquo;s thoughts is to draw but a
faint picture of how day and night it lay upon
his heart. How when on land the early morning
found him out betimes on the Hoe, at Plymouth,
telescope in hand, gazing out to sea. If a storm
raged and the spray flew high for a moment it
seemed to his sinking heart that it was Winstanley&rsquo;s
lighthouse over again and that there
was no Eddystone!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Again his heart leaped in gratitude a moment
afterwards when the upright column&mdash;strong,
firm, immovable&mdash;pointing black and clear
against the sky, came to view, and a deep
&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; would burst from his lips.</p>

<p>And now the months flew by and the great
work neared its end. Smeaton himself chose the
last details&mdash;the iron railings&mdash;the glass for the
lantern. In the upper storeroom directly beneath
the ceiling he had the motto carved&mdash;&ldquo;Except
the Lord build the house they labor
in vain that build it.&rdquo; And the mason&rsquo;s last
work was a &ldquo;Laus Deo&rdquo; in stone.</p>

<p>Towards the end Smeaton could not leave it.
With his own hands he fitted the windows in
their sashes&mdash;fixed the gilt ball on the top&mdash;no
easy matter&mdash;but he had ever filled the post of
danger himself. He asked no one to put himself
where he was not willing too to go. Expert as any
skilled mechanic, he himself gave his great work
its finishing touches. Twenty-four candles in a
chandelier formed the light. The lightning-conductor
was fixed&mdash;the rooms finished. The
magnificent column towered to seventy feet, the
lantern and gilt ball twenty-eight inches higher,
and on October 16th, 1759, the work was done.</p>

<p>Three years later a mighty storm broke along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the coast, wrecking docks and ships and harbours,
but the Eddystone stood firm.</p>

<p>And now Smeaton&rsquo;s name was made. Other
feats followed. Other triumphs awaited him&mdash;the
building of docks and harbours and bridges&mdash;but
the thing that men will ever link with his
name is the Eddystone. After the stress and
struggle of public life, he went back again to
the old home of his boyhood. He gathered
again about him his workshop, his study, his
observatory. And so he worked to the end.
He could not help it. He could not live without
his tools.</p>

<p>Great man though he was, his wants were
very few and simple. Offers of riches and
magnificence had no power to tempt him, and
when he refused a post abroad which meant
wealth and position, the Russian Princess who
offered it exclaimed, in wondering admiration&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall go back to Russia and tell them there
is one man who has <em>not</em> his price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was happiest in the quiet of his own
home. As a boy he had been rather retiring
and thoughtful. As a man he was found the
same. Simple, modest, while he would converse
easily on other subjects, it was hardly possible
to get him to talk of self. In this, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in his life-work, &ldquo;he was indeed a very great
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had had a long life of work&mdash;hard, incessant
toil&mdash;from six to sixty, though it had been
work that he had loved. It may be he had
overtaxed his strength, for as age crept on he
grew less robust. In his sixty-eighth year he
had a slight stroke. He feared a gradually
clouding brain. &ldquo;The shadow must lengthen
as the sun goes down,&rdquo; he said to himself.
But this distress was spared those dear to him,
and with not much suffering, on the 28th
October, 1792, he passed away. They buried
him in the old church of Whitkirk, and raised
a tablet to his memory, naming in it that great
work of his that will &ldquo;convey to distant ages,
as it does to every nation of the globe, the name
of its constructor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The world looks still upon John Smeaton as
a wonderful engineer&mdash;a great mechanic&mdash;a man
who climbed to the top of his profession, and
the sound of whose fame spread over Europe;
but he will ever be best remembered by the
light of the Eddystone, that memorial monument
that stood firm for more than a century, sometimes
hid in blinding spray, anon gleaming out
clear and steady, a rescuer from shipwreck and
death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Till 1877 storms continued to beat upon it
without avail. Then, owing to the undermining
of a portion of the reef, it was thought well
to build a new house on another part of the
rock. The old base still stands on the old
place, and the upper rooms have been put on
the Hoe at Plymouth.</p>

<p>These are, after all, the best monuments we
could have of the builder. Welded into the
stones, it seems to us we can trace, not alone
genius and great mechanical power, but a patience
in difficulty, a courage in danger, and in face of
long, wearing months of anxiety. It is these,
perhaps, more than all else, for which we honour
the name of Smeaton.</p>

<h2>JOHN FLAXMAN</h2>
<hr class="l6" />

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Had</span> we passed along one of the poorer
streets of the city of London some 150
years ago, we might have chanced on a humble
shop displaying in the window plaster-casts and
figures in clay, and had we lifted the latch and
entered, in the cramped space behind the counter
we should have found the child who was one
day to become England&rsquo;s greatest sculptor, John
Flaxman.</p>

<p>A ricketty, weakly baby in a high stuffed
child&rsquo;s chair, so that his little pale face might
be on a level with the counter; the sweet
dreamy eyes looked out on the world, all unthinking
that a day was coming when the fame
of his name would reach wherever men knew
and loved his art.</p>

<p>Born in the city of York in 1755, a few
months before the Flaxmans settled in London,
there were times when his father and mother
hardly believed they would be able to &ldquo;rear&rdquo;
the delicate child. Attacks of illness and weakness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
were common to him. Indeed, one day he
was seized with a fit of gasping so severe that
the breath seemed to leave his body, and they
even laid him out for dead, but he revived, and
his breath came again, and by-and-by he even
grew. Few amusements, no childish games
were open to the little cripple. The green
fields, the blue of the country skies were to
him things unknown. The dingy four walls of
the narrow cramped shop had to serve him
instead. But day by day he grew quick to
note the familiar beauty of his father&rsquo;s casts.
He came to see the shape of these white things
with the eye of the poet and the artist. There
came into his mind the strong desire to copy,
inborn in most children, and the baby fingers
set to work to mould, and fashion, and make
some likeness&mdash;if even a dim one&mdash;to those of
his father&rsquo;s models. In these old days gentlemen
were accustomed to wear bunches of seals
dangling from their watch-chains, and the child
used to keep a stock of wax, and when he
thought a customer seemed kind, he would
summon courage to ask him to let him take
the impression on the soft wax.</p>

<p>In little John&rsquo;s early years, when he was as
yet a baby of five, a great ceremony took place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
in London, the coronation of King George&nbsp;III.
Rumour went that to celebrate the great event
there was to be a coronation medal struck,
and that hundreds of these were to be thrown
to the crowd. The cripple child in the dingy
side street of the great city set his little heart
on possessing one of these treasures, and begged
his father to get him one. But Flaxman was
not successful. On the way home, with his
mind full of his disappointment, his eye happened
to light on a plated button on the pavement,
stamped with a horse and jockey. He
picked it up. Would he disappoint his little
son, or deceive him? He decided on deceiving
him, and gave the eager and expectant child the
button. The boy received the trophy in wonderment.
He was glad to get it, but he remarked
that it seemed a strange medal for a
coronation!</p>

<p>Customers who came to Flaxman&rsquo;s house
could hardly help noticing the child who sat
behind the counter, the big head on the lame
body, the high shoulders, the beautiful pure
eyes, the sensitive, proud face. They spoke to
him, and they found him no common child.</p>

<p>One day, by good luck, when little John was
hardly more than seven, a customer, a Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Matthew, a clergyman, came to Flaxman&rsquo;s shop.
Writing of that visit, when it had become a
memory and the child a great man, Mr. Matthew
says&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went to the shop of old Flaxman to have
a figure repaired, and whilst I was standing
there I heard a child cough behind the counter.
I looked over, and there I saw a little boy seated
on a small chair, with a large chair before him,
on which lay a book he was reading. His fine
eyes and beautiful forehead interested me, and I
said, &lsquo;What book is that?&rsquo; He raised himself
on his crutches, bowed, and said, &lsquo;Sir, it is a
Latin book, and I am trying to learn it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Aye, indeed!&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;You are a
fine boy, but this is not the proper book. I
will bring you a right one to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did as I promised, and the acquaintance
thus casually begun ripened into one of the best
friendships of my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is a picture! The child of seven trying
patiently to make out his Latin book&mdash;his weakly
frame on one chair, the unwieldy volume spread
out before him on another. The beautiful eyes
and brow, the winning smile, and the long,
brown hair curling to the shoulders.</p>

<p>But the wheel of his fortune seemed as if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
had got a turn. Mr. Matthew was as good as
his word, and brought him the promised book,
and more followed. Translations of old Greek
fables and stories from Homer that stirred the
imagination of the boy. Then followed the
fascinating adventures of Don Quixote. These
fired his brain. How great and how heroic it
seemed to him to rescue maidens in distress, to
set the wrongs of the world right. So strong a
hold did the thought take of the imagination of
the child that one day, hobbling on his little
crutches, he started off for Hyde Park in the
hope that he might perchance find some forlorn
maiden in need of his protection! But no old-world
lady of the kind did he happen on among
the thousands of teeming London&mdash;either in the
Park or Kensington Gardens&mdash;and he had to
come home cast down and disappointed.</p>

<p>Meantime he strove and worked and laboured
in his own childish way&mdash;with perhaps no great
present results&mdash;receiving now and then even a
check from which the sensitive mind recoiled, as
when one day he showed an artist a drawing of
a human eye, to be met with the quizzical
question, &ldquo;Is that an oyster?&rdquo; Perhaps more
secretly after that, but still as perseveringly as
ever, he worked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Long years after, a friend gazing on these
early works was struck with proofs of his
diligence as a child, and asked him how he had
managed to do them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; Flaxman answered, &ldquo;we are never too
young to learn what is useful, or too old to grow
wise and good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he was about ten years old a better
gift than any fortune could bestow was granted
to him. The feebleness of childhood seemed to
leave him. The sickly frame seemed suddenly
to knit itself together. The weakly limbs
gradually strengthened, and the boy was able to
throw away his crutches.</p>

<p>No need now to sit solitary in the cramped
little shop behind the counter, dreaming lonely
day-dreams and fashioning his models all by
himself. With new strength a new life was
opening up to him&mdash;or rather the old life grew
day by day transformed and beautified.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Matthew, the wife of his friend
the clergyman, who first drew the boy from his
life of loneliness. She was touched and interested
in him, and she asked him to her
house. He went and he went again. He met
there men who fired his smouldering longing
one day to be a sculptor&mdash;to do some great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
thing in the world of art. Mrs. Matthew had
many friends among such. At other times he
spent evenings not less delightful when she
herself read aloud from Virgil and Homer soul-stirring
tales of ancient heroes&mdash;and the boy sat
by drinking in the poetry while he tried with
eager, untaught fingers to draw some of the
passages that took his fancy. Again she would
lay aside her book and talk to him of the
wonders of sculpture, while there sprang up in
his heart a great longing amounting almost to a
passion.</p>

<p>No wonder these were golden hours, full of
pleasure to young John, and looked back upon
many a time in after years as among the
happiest times of his life.</p>

<p>A gentleman, seeing some of these boyish
attempts, gave the boy an order for a set of
drawings, and by and by more orders followed.</p>

<p>When he was eleven years old he left the
privacy and quiet of the little side eddy of the
stream of life in which he had been living and
struck out, as it were, into the mid-stream. That
year he won a prize from the Society of Arts for
models of figures in clay. Two years later he
was again successful. What we know as the
Royal Academy then first came into being, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
when it was in its second year, and when
Flaxman was only fifteen years old, he exhibited
models there. Step by step, small steps at first,
he was entering on the beginning of that which
for long had been the desire of his heart. In
the same year he entered as an Academy student,
and won the silver medal. People already were
beginning to acknowledge his outstanding ability.
Rewards, prizes came upon him one by one.
The boy&rsquo;s outlook was beginning to be very
bright, and his heart was beginning to beat high
with hope, when just as he had reached the age
of sixteen he got an unexpected check.</p>

<p>He made up his mind to try for the gold
medal&mdash;the highest reward of merit&mdash;and among
all the students he was generally allowed to
have the best chance. Hardly a fellow-student
but felt sure that he would get it. &ldquo;Flaxman!
Flaxman!&rdquo; they cried almost unanimously, for
they were strongly impressed with the skill and
ability of the grave, reserved boy. Speaking of
this time in later years Flaxman said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had made up my mind that I was to win....
It was given by Reynolds to Engleheart.
I burst into tears. This sharp lesson humbled
my conceit, and I determined to redouble my
exertions....&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>May he perhaps have over-estimated his own
skill? Years after he said of himself&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was the most conceited artist of the day.&rdquo;
And yet where another might have been downcast
he refused to be discouraged. He was upheld
by a strong and silent sense of power within
him. He went home to his father, and he said,
&ldquo;Give me time, and I will yet produce works
which the Academy will be proud to acknowledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Engleheart, the winner of the medal, was
never heard of in later life, while the loser made
for himself a name that afterwards &ldquo;waxed
wide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now he worked harder than ever. He studied,
he exhibited, he moulded, he designed the figure
for a statue of Alexander the Great, which
brought him some fame. But his father could
not keep him, and he was driven to look about
and bethink himself how he could keep himself.
At this time&mdash;the most needy, perhaps, of his
life&mdash;a door seemed to open to him. He fell in
with the great Staffordshire potter, Josiah
Wedgwood, and Wedgwood, with that keen eye
of his ever on the outlook to discover talent,
instantly recognised it in the boy.</p>

<p>A great time was beginning for pottery. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
ages hideous things had adorned people&rsquo;s houses
and tables till Wedgwood arose, and there
entered his great mind the idea of making
common things beautiful, of giving people something
to look at, even at their meals, that would
raise their tastes and be a sort of education.
After Wedgwood discovered young Flaxman he
gave him some orders. The boy threw his whole
soul into the work. Not that it was such work
as always showed the artist at his best. The
sculptor had first to make the model in wax.
Then a mould was taken of this, and into this
the potter&rsquo;s stuff, soft as dough, was carefully
pressed. The thing was not finished yet. It
remained for it still to be fired and polished, and
so it is not wonderful if some of the delicacy
and finish of the first design may have been
occasionally lost.</p>

<p>But with Flaxman&rsquo;s work Wedgwood was
satisfied, and while he worked hard for him he
paid him handsomely. It was not the sort of
thing to bring him name and fame, but there
was always the need to live to be faced, and he
bravely took what offered and was thankful.
And by living simply and saving where he could,
he managed to keep himself by what he made.
He faced this time of drudgery quietly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
patiently, bringing to bear upon its hardships
something of that serene spirit that belonged
to him all through life.</p>

<p>He gave to Wedgwood, as far as in him lay,
of his best. Models of the four seasons, models
of the ancient gods and goddesses&mdash;those deities
whose stories were familiar to him from his
childhood, Juno, Jupiter, Minerva, Apollo&mdash;models
of vases. And besides these, chimney-pieces,
plaques, candlesticks, inkstands, anything
and everything, for Wedgwood held that a
common teapot or a jug might be still a thing
of beauty. For the models of the ancient gods
he would get perhaps 10<i>s.</i> each, and for a pair
of vases as much as 3 3<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Some of these were so exquisitely done that
Wedgwood said more than once, &ldquo;It really hurts
me to think of parting with these gems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Long years afterwards, when he had reached
the top of the tree, Flaxman used to find endless
pleasure in talking of these humble labours.</p>

<p>And all this time he was leading a very quiet
life. That strong thirst for knowledge that had
always been his, spurred him on to learn all he
could. So during the day he worked at casts
and models, and in the evenings he sketched or
turned to his beloved poets. Either he preferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the old Greek poets&rsquo; company to that of living
friends, or it might be that the slight deformity
that was his through life&mdash;the high shoulders,
the sidling gait&mdash;left him shy and sensitive, and
in a measure inclined to creep into his shell.</p>

<p>Looking over the huge portfolio of Flaxman&rsquo;s
drawings that one can still see to-day, it is easy
to discover where he went for most of his
subjects. The poets came in for their share, and
also history and portraits, but his great delight
was to produce scenes from the Bible and the
<cite>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</cite>, &ldquo;The Marys at the Sepulchre,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Flight into Egypt,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Angels
round the Cradle of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But although he was getting to be known
among men of talent he was still poor and
struggling. It is proof enough of this for us
to read how at this time he made his busts half
life-size and of clay, whereas had he been rich
they would surely have been full-size and of
marble. About this time he began to talk of
what had been with him till now a secret longing.
It was to see Rome. The desire had been
long growing in his heart. To Rome sculptors
and painters flock, for it is the great city of
sculpture and painting, and to a sculptor it is
as if his education were unfinished, so long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
his eyes have not feasted on those beautiful
examples of art.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I remain here,&rdquo; he said sadly, &ldquo;I shall be
accused of ignorance concerning those noble
works of art which are to the sculptor what
learning is to a man of genius.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About this time he took what seemed a foolish
step, looking alone to the progress of his art.
He married. Sir Joshua, the President of the
Royal Academy, who had <em>not</em> given him the gold
medal, met him in the street one day and
stopped him. &ldquo;Ha! Flaxman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have
heard that you have married. I tell you you are
ruined for an artist. You cannot now go to Rome
to study the great sculptors of antiquity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Young Flaxman went home downcast. Not
to go to Rome! Not to realise his boyhood&rsquo;s
golden dreams and his life&rsquo;s ambition!</p>

<p>He told his wife what had happened. She
met him with the brave reply, &ldquo;You will e&rsquo;en
go to Rome and I will accompany you. We
must work and economise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now for the next five weary years this
brave young couple put their shoulders to the
wheel. She kept house and he worked&mdash;harder
than ever&mdash;for Wedgwood chiefly&mdash;toiling for
long hours, but upheld all the time by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
thought of the goal to which he was straining.
That journey to Rome!&mdash;the very thought of it
made all hardship easy. He turned out much
beautiful work for Wedgwood at this time.
Groups of children&mdash;romping, skipping, playing
&ldquo;blind man&rsquo;s buff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing that meant making money came
amiss to him. He even collected what was
known as &ldquo;watch rates&rdquo; for the parish of St.
Anne&rsquo;s, and might have been seen going about
with an ink-bottle in his buttonhole.</p>

<p>Often the desires of our heart tarry long in
coming to us. This was among the times of
hardest work and trial in all Flaxman&rsquo;s life, and
he came out of it well. At the end of the five
years the needed money was collected!</p>

<p>And now, while the great event of his life was
drawing near, his boyhood had left him, and he
was entering on the work of the man. Already
he had gained some fame in London. The newspapers
took notice of his going.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We understand that Flaxman the sculptor
is about to leave his modest mansion in Wardour
Street for Rome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now a very feast of delight awaited him.
With his arrival in Rome, what wonders opened
to his view, what grandeur and sublimity in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
examples of ancient art! What skill and magnificence
and luxuriance he saw in the churches,
what wealth of creation on their walls and
windows and cupolas, what sculpture, what painting!
It was as if an enchanted world had
suddenly spread itself out before his eyes.</p>

<p>Gradually it came to be known that Flaxman
had arrived, and there gathered about him men
of taste and culture&mdash;rich men many of them&mdash;men
of position. But the great sculptor&rsquo;s ways
were just the simple ones of old. He was not
easily affected by the great of the world. He
was always his manly simple self to rich and
poor alike. He adopted no more luxurious ways
of living with his days of prosperity. He prized
money little, just as a something in exchange
for which he could get food and clothing, or
with which he might help the poor and suffering.
The fine character of the boy seemed to have
expanded into fuller beauty in the man.</p>

<p>After his stay in Rome he returned to London,
his spirit, one could imagine, bathed in a very
inspiration from all he had seen and heard. He
came back to his native land with a name
made, and quietly set about getting a house, a
studio, assistants, workmen, models.</p>

<p>He executed a statue of Lord Mansfield, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
which he was paid 2,500. Prices were indeed
altered from the old days, in which he counted
himself well paid with ten shillings for the
model of a goddess!</p>

<p>&ldquo;This little man cuts us all out,&rdquo; said one
generous sculptor to another, willing to acknowledge
Flaxman&rsquo;s great superiority. Honours
now flowed in upon him. He was made an
Associate of the Royal Academy. He was given
the Professorship of the Chair of Sculpture. At
his first lecture he was enthusiastically cheered.
He had climbed to the highest height of his art.
It almost seemed as if no honour remained to
be bestowed. He was surrounded by fame and
applause, but he was in no wise uplifted. So
the years went on in the delight of the work he
loved.</p>

<p>But, unexpectedly and all unknown to his
friends, his life was drawing to a close. In the
winter of 1826 he caught a cold, seeming for
a time to be slightly, though not seriously,
ailing. In the beginning of December he grew
much worse, but he would not go to bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I lie I cannot breathe,&rdquo; he said. So,
sitting up to the end, and with scarce a struggle,
he passed away on the 7th of December.</p>

<p>They buried him quietly in the churchyard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
St. Giles-in-the-Fields. There was no great
publicity, no large concourse of people. Just a
few friends, a few artists&mdash;the greatest&mdash;were
there, men who in tremulous, hushed voices said
to each other they &ldquo;had lost something greater
and dearer than they should see again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turning from the ending of his life, we cannot
but feel that we are turning from the record
of a man who has lived it well.</p>

<p>An enthusiastic admirer has said, &ldquo;He was a
remarkable mixture of simplicity and genius&mdash;were
you to try any other ingredients you would
scarcely form so glorious a creature.&rdquo; And we
hardly think he was far wrong.</p>

<p>We can see very clearly the fine simplicity of
his nature in his treatment of his workmen.
They were to him rather friends than servants.
They in their turn repaid him with a warm and
devoted affection, calling him &ldquo;the best master
God ever made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To the end, as well in time of difficulty and
of toil as in time of triumph, the man retained
very much those qualities that had drawn out
people&rsquo;s love for him in boyhood, the kindly
word from the customer in the shop behind the
counter. The world offered him of its best, as
it has a way of doing to those who do well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
for themselves, but it had no power to draw
him from his work and the simplicity of his
simple home-life. It was only and always to
that which is highest and best that he gave
of his genius. That noble mind of his could
stoop to nothing less. In churches all over
England are to be found beautiful creations of
his. In him were at once goodness and genius
linked together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If ever purity visited this earth,&rdquo; someone
has said, &ldquo;it remained with Flaxman.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>SIR HUMPHREY DAVY.</h2>
<hr class="l6" />

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Amid</span> the wild beautiful scenery of Cornwall,
where the waters of the Atlantic wash our
English shores, was born in the winter of 1778
the greatest chemist England has ever seen.
We read in our childish geography books that
for being the birthplace of Humphrey Davy the
town of Penzance has for long been famous, for
the coming into the world of that man whose
name is perhaps best known for the invention
of the Miners&rsquo; Safety Lamp, that has lit the
darkness of our coal mines and saved hundreds
of human lives.</p>

<p>Humphrey was the son of a wood-carver, a
man not high up in the world, but we find him
free enough from the straits of poverty that
have often been the cradle of genius, though,
indeed, a cradle out of which genius has had
a way of growing to sturdy stalwart manhood.
The child from the outset entered on life with
eagerness and enthusiasm, seeming to take a
firm, earnest grip, as it were, even from babyhood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
It was this same vigour of mind that
spurred him on all through&mdash;in boyhood and
manhood alike&mdash;that made him face difficulty
with such a brave, dauntless spirit, and overcome
obstacles with never a thought of letting them
overcome him.</p>

<p>He was quick, energetic, and alert, even as a
child. When hardly more than five years old
his mother often noticed him with baby fingers
rapidly turning the pages of some book as if
he were counting their number or glancing at
the pictures. To her no small astonishment on
questioning him, she found the lisping baby lips
could repeat the story. It was the same through
life. Long years after, when he was a great
chemist, making wonderful experiments in his
laboratory, he had no patience with slowness.
He would keep several experiments going at
the same time, attending first to one, then to
another. If the exact instrument he wanted
were not at hand, he would recklessly break or
alter another to suit his purpose. His impetuous
spirit could never brook delay. With him quickness
meant power, and while quick he was also
sure.</p>

<p>As a child he specially loved the <cite>Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress</cite>. The charm of its word-pictures, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
characters fired his quick imagination. And
history too, especially the history of his own
country. These two, it may be, inspired him
very early to a love of romance and story, and
among the boys at school in Penzance he was
not slow to gain the reputation of story-teller.
Some were tales of fun, others tales of thrilling
wonder and terror, but all flowed easily from
the boy&rsquo;s lips and held his listeners enthralled.</p>

<p>When he was no more than eight years old
he would take his stand on a cart in the middle
of the market-place, his boyish figure drawn to
its full height, and there harangue the boys who
gathered in little groups to hear the young
orator. At school there was nothing in any
way remarkable about young Humphrey, except,
perhaps, that somewhere hid away within him
was the gift of rhyme or the gift of poetry.
English and Latin verse alike came easy to him,
and by-and-by his schoolfellows found out his
facility, and they pressed him into their service
to compose valentines and love-letters. But
except for this he seemed in these early years
to be nothing more than a happy, healthy
English boy, full of fun and spirits. He would
fish off Penzance Pier for grey mullet, catching
more than his companions. He would bait his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
hooks and wait till a shoal of these difficult fish
were swimming about the bait, then by a clever
jerk of his tackle entangle and capture them.
His love of fishing remained with him all
through life&mdash;almost to the end. So strong
was it that even as a man he never could conceal
his annoyance if unsuccessful, or if he discovered
a friend to have caught a larger number
than he. So keen and ardent was he that he
would dress himself in green that the wily fish
might know no difference between him and the
green trees and grassy banks!</p>

<p>In his boyhood we find it difficult to trace
any germs of that talent for experimenting and
inventing that distinguished him in later life.
He scooped turnips hollow, and lighted up the
insides with candles&mdash;but what boy has not
experimented in the same way? He made
squibs, or &ldquo;thunder-powder,&rdquo; that exploded on
a stone with a loud report that delighted his
companions. But there is no trace of an unusual
bent of mind here&mdash;just an example of
an ardent, eager English boy, full of life and
spirits.</p>

<p>In 1793 he went to school in Truro, not far
from Penzance. He was quick, but that was all&mdash;a
clever boy, not a prodigy. His master, writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
long years after, when the boy&rsquo;s name had become
a household word in England, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not at that time discover any extraordinary
abilities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It must have been a school of the old sort
that Mr. Davy had lighted upon for his son,
for the story goes that young Humphrey, at
times in scrapes like other boys, while punishment
hung over him, had these doggrel lines
fired off by his master at his head&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Now, Master Dvy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, sir, I hve &rsquo;e,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No one shall save &rsquo;e;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good Master Dvy.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And with the end of the rhyme down came
the flat ruler on the open palm of the culprit!
School, while it may not have done him a great
deal of good, at least did not do him much
harm. His own frank, buoyant mind prevented
his being twisted into a cut-and-dried shape,
or pressed into any special mould. Long years
after he gave thanks that in those young days
he was left very much to his own bent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I am I have made myself,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I say this without vanity, and in pure simplicity
of heart.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>So passed the long, sunshiny days of school-time,
and when he was sixteen he left school
finally. After that, for one short, blissful year
he shot and fished and lived chiefly in the open,
surrounded by the beauties of Cornish scenery,
for which in after years his heart always kept a
tender memory, when the bustle and din of
a city, and the whirl of city life, had well-nigh
drowned for him Nature&rsquo;s softer tones. He
grew then to know familiarly bird and beast,
and rock and flower. In after years, when his
life was more fully filled than most men&rsquo;s, a
chance word or reference would seem to waft
him a whiff of the sea off the Cornish shore,
and a great longing would seize him for the
loved scenes of his childhood. Then, in the
midst of his work, he would take a hurried
run home. During this year of holiday, which
he enjoyed with the whole-heartedness of a
careless, happy boy, he collected a number of
birds, and stuffed them with his own hands&mdash;and
with not a little skill.</p>

<p>Almost to the end of life he kept his love
of shooting. As in fishing he tried to efface
himself and deceive the wily fish, so in shooting
he was strangely beset by fear of an accident,
and he would study to make himself as conspicuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
as possible in a scarlet hat! Almost
at the end, when his strength was failing, it
is pathetic enough to find him ask to be driven
to the field, that he might still fire a shot.</p>

<p>But already over his young life there brooded
its first great shadow. In 1794 his father died.
It may have been this which helped to change
young Humphrey from the happy, careless boy to
something more serious, more thoughtful, that
fixed his mind on the responsibilities life was so
full of, that helped to turn it from mere sport
and pleasure to the improvement of his mind&mdash;to
the gaining of knowledge. At any rate, about
this time the boy laid hold of life, and, as a
rower in a boat-race might do, steadied down
to his responsibilities.</p>

<p>His mother apprenticed him to a surgeon and
apothecary in Penzance, and straightway with
that ardour and enthusiasm that carried him
through so much of his great work in later life,
he fell in love with chemistry. He tried boyish
experiments. He used the rudest instruments&mdash;anything
that he could lay hands on. Pots,
pans, vessels in the surgery&mdash;nothing was safe
or sacred from his touch. He filled the house
with strange and hideous odours&mdash;he burnt
holes in his sister&rsquo;s dresses. When he turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the garret into a laboratory his good old guardian
would exclaim&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This boy Humphrey is incorrigible! Was
there ever so idle a dog? He will blow us all
into the air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half an hour later he would proudly and
fondly call the boy &ldquo;Philosopher,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sir
Humphrey,&rdquo; as if already his prophetic eye
pierced the future and beheld his greatness.</p>

<p>So he spent much of the day, and in the long
summer evenings he would ramble along the
seashore as far as Marazion armed with a
hammer with which to chip off &ldquo;specimens&rdquo;
from the rocks, for already geology had thrown
over him its peculiar spell. He would end
these happy days with tea at a favourite aunt&rsquo;s.
And it was not merely boyish enjoyment these
solitary rambles brought. They and the still
small voice of Nature were telling on him.
Gradually they were making and moulding the
boy, approaching now as he was, very near to
the threshold of manhood.</p>

<p>Even then, however, he was trying to improve
himself. With the roar of the waves and the
howl of the winds in his ears in these lonely
walks, he would declaim to the elements, in the
hope of softening a defect in his voice. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
probably arose from his having what is called
&ldquo;no ear.&rdquo; He had no notion of either time or
tune. It used to trouble him much that he
never could keep step in the Volunteer Infantry
corps to which he belonged, and someone tried
to teach him &ldquo;God Save the King,&rdquo; but without
success.</p>

<p>The surgical part of his profession was always
disagreeable and distasteful to the boy, although
from no want of courage on his part. The story
goes that one day about this time he was bitten
in the leg by a dog supposed to be mad. No
sooner did he realise what had happened to him
than he there and then took a knife and cut the
piece right out of his leg, and then went to the
surgery and had the wound cauterised.</p>

<p>His mind was such that it instinctively rose
to emergencies and grappled with anything&mdash;a
big thing or a little thing. Both were to him
alike. Knowledge was what he wanted. He
wanted to know as much as possible, and he
liked to get to the bottom of a difficulty for
himself. Into each new thing that came his
way he threw himself with all the ardour and
impetuosity of his nature. Nor was he merely
practical and nothing more. He had that sympathy
and delicacy of mind that revelled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
communing with nature. This expressed itself
in sonnets and poems&mdash;some of which he wrote
when he was only twelve. A great poetic
genius once said of him&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Davy had not been the first chemist he
would have been the first poet of his age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But poetry was not the field in which he was
to shine. His genius was for experiments. He
went on eagerly experimenting on anything&mdash;heat,
light, air. Anything connected with
chemistry drew him as with a magnet. The
first time some real experimenting apparatus
found its way to his hands he could not conceal
his delight. Specially did an air-pump charm
him. It was to him as a new and fascinating
toy to a child. He kept working the piston up
and down, and would hardly let it go!</p>

<p>And now it seemed as if it were almost time
for him to try his wings in the larger air of the
great world. More than one man had come to
Penzance who perhaps gave the boy a foretaste
of the delights he was to know by-and-by as a
man in the atmosphere of culture and talent in
which his lot was to be cast. Among these
were Josiah Wedgwood, the Staffordshire Potter,
and young Watt, the son of the inventor of the
Condensing Steam Engine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>There was about young Humphrey&rsquo;s outward
appearance about this time nothing specially
attractive. He had round shoulders, not a
comely face, and a manner that was in no way
remarkable or engaging, but surely the light of
genius must have shone from his eyes!</p>

<p>However, such as he was outwardly, he now
prepared to launch away into the great world.
A professor of chemistry in Bristol had heard of
his experiments in light and heat, and proposed
to him that he should become assistant in the
Pneumatic Institution there. There was not
much money to be earned by it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be maintained, but the fund will
not furnish a salary from which a man can lay
up anything.&rdquo; So they told him. But was it
not his most direct road to fortune?</p>

<p>Perhaps Humphrey thought so. At any rate,
the Penzance surgeon was prevailed upon to cut
short the term of the boy&rsquo;s apprenticeship, &ldquo;on
account of the singularly promising talents Mr.
Davy had displayed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Humphrey went out from his native town,
and from his home, as many a young man had
gone before him, with a heart beating high with
hope, and, as his young, ardent spirit believed,
the world spread out before him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>And certainly a brilliant future was opening
to the boy. He turned his steps to Bristol,
throwing himself in his own characteristic way
into his new work.</p>

<p>He made experiments on air and gases, some
of these daring and dangerous enough, and entailing
not a little personal risk. But while
these things lay nearest to his heart, he had eye
and ear both open for all that was going forward
in his new life. He was so many-sided himself,
it was as if he could not come in contact with
anyone without catching some spark of interest
from him&mdash;the philosopher, the poet, the physician,
the sportsman. He had something in
common with all.</p>

<p>He entered into his work as if body and mind
knew no fatigue. If an idea came into his head
he could not rest until he had worked it out.
If he broke down in health, he simply started
afresh when he had recovered.</p>

<p>In his spare time he wrote books and pamphlets
on chemistry, so that in writing and experimenting
his name came to be known to the scientific
men of the day. And now it seemed as if one
step in fame followed another. Success was
crowned by success.</p>

<p>He was appointed Assistant Lecturer in Chemistry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to the Royal Institution in 1801. He had
now entered on manhood, and was launched on
the great world of London, having all the
ability to carry himself through. He may have
been handicapped with slight flaws of manner.
If he appeared over-confident, it probably was
that in reality he was shy and timid, and
attempted to cover these little awkwardnesses.
His friends grieved in secret over the noticeable
change, fearing lest with simplicity of manner
he might throw over simplicity of character.
But no man is, after all, perfect, and in spite of
this, Davy was rapidly mounting the ladder of
success.</p>

<p>The young chemist soon discovered that his
lectures drew crowds, even created a great and
extraordinary sensation. In imagination we can
picture the lecture-room, the crowded audience&mdash;all
sorts and conditions, from lovers of science,
ladies of fashion, men of rank, to the threadbare-coated
student&mdash;eagerly watching the experiments,
and all drinking in his words as the
young lecturer, fired with his subject, animated
with all the charm of which he was so complete
a master the dry bones of geology with life and
breath, or again brought the study of chemistry,
hitherto unget-at-able and out of reach, down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
their level. The audience hung on his lips spellbound.</p>

<p>The young popular lecturer was caressed and
made much of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Davy, covered with glory,&rdquo; writes a friend
at this time, &ldquo;dines with me to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon they made him Professor of Chemistry
to the Institution. Promotion followed promotion,
but each year was a spur to greater
exertion. Time would fail to enumerate the
steps in his triumphs. A continuous sun seemed
to shine upon him. And his strength seemed
equal to all demands. Money had never been
of much account to him. Now, indeed, he
might have had it in abundance had he chosen,
by helping forward manufactures with his
scientific knowledge, but that was not his aim.
His ambition was scientific glory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be useful to science and mankind was the
pursuit in which he gloried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The years that followed were years full of hard
work. In 1812 he was knighted. It seemed
as if almost everything he touched were like
a gold mine which yielded some new treasure
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Science,&rdquo; he said once to a young man
anxious to pursue it, &ldquo;is a harsh mistress, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
repays one poorly.&rdquo; But for him she surely
rather had &ldquo;full measure pressed down and
running over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now, when he was about thirty-seven,
his thoughts were first turned to the great
triumph of his life, the invention that was to
make his name famous.</p>

<p>There was in England, especially in the north
and midland counties, a great and crying evil&mdash;the
danger in which our miners and their
families lived, as these brave men daily and
hourly carried their lives in their hands. Constantly
the newspapers were filled with terrible
accounts of accidents in our coal-pits&mdash;mines
exploding, men and boys and horses being blown
to pieces or buried alive&mdash;and always from the
same cause&mdash;the want of a safety lamp. A great
quantity of gas got cooped up, in spite of
contrivances for leading pure air into the murky
passages of the mines, and these gases, directly
they came in contact with a naked flame, exploded.
There had been old days in which men
worked by a feeble light borrowed from the
phosphorescence of decaying fish-skins or &ldquo;steel
mills,&rdquo; which gave out fitful gleams or sparks
when a piece of flint was struck against them;
but these days had passed, and accidents multiplied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
And though men were startled and
shocked when they read of them, still the wholesale
slaughter went on. The gas exploded,
bursting up everything near, killing the miners,
erupting great masses of coal and dust and
mangled men and horses. And not only this,
but it blew down the trap-doors, leaving men
to die of &ldquo;after-damp,&rdquo; the more horrible death
of suffocation, because lingering and slow.</p>

<p>To remedy this crying evil Davy bent the
whole force of his brilliant intellect, and after
much thought invented the Safety Lamp. He
surrounded the flame of his lamp with wire
gauze. The gas entered and exploded within
it, but the explosion did not pass outward.</p>

<p>It was the most glorious triumph of his genius.
In 1816 it was adopted. With his &ldquo;Davy&rdquo; in
his hand there was now no fear for the miner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The highest ambition of my life,&rdquo; he wrote,
&ldquo;has been to deserve the name of a friend to
humanity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took out no patent. He wanted no money
for it. It was reward enough for him to see it
work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you had patented it,&rdquo; said a friend to him
one day, &ldquo;you might have been drawing your
five or ten thousand a year.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my good friend,&rdquo; was his reply, &ldquo;I never
thought of such a thing. My sole object was
to serve the cause of humanity. It might undoubtedly
enable me to put four horses in my
carriage, but what would it avail me to have
it said that Sir Humphrey drives his carriage-and-four?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I value it,&rdquo; he said again, &ldquo;more than anything
I ever did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now the world&rsquo;s honours waited upon
him. In 1818 Government made him Baronet.
In 1820 he was made President of the Royal
Society.</p>

<p>But already in the zenith of his triumph,
there were small signs that showed too surely
that he was failing. In 1826 he retired from
the Presidentship, and later in the year he was
attacked by apoplexy, followed by paralysis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; he wrote pathetically from
Rome, &ldquo;a ruin among ruins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so he began to look death in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not wish to live so far as I am personally
concerned,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I have views
which I could develop&mdash;if it please God to save
my life&mdash;which would be useful to science and
mankind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Never again, however, was he to return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
England. In Rome he had a second seizure.
He had a great longing to reach Geneva, and a
few hours after he arrived, although he appeared
at first to rally, he took ill, and there passed
away quietly and peacefully, not merely, as
someone has it, &ldquo;one of the greatest, but one of
the most benevolent and amiable of men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They buried him in the little burying-ground
at Geneva, the long procession wending its way
to his last resting-place on foot. His widow
erected a tablet to his memory in Westminster
Abbey.</p>

<p>He was the greatest chemist of the age; but
after all, his best memorial will abide in the
memory of his fellow-men as the inventor of the
Safety Lamp.</p>

<p>To himself his invention brought no small
happiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was never more affected,&rdquo; he said on one
occasion, &ldquo;than by a written address I received
from the working colliers, when I was in the
north, thanking me, on behalf of themselves
and their families, for the preservation of their
lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His, indeed, is a career of striking brilliancy.
He is like some mountain climber who climbs
ever upwards. And we, looking up, seem to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
him leap from one dazzling peak to another.
Honours and attainments were his such as come
to few men in this world, but we cannot but
feel that what gave him the greatest joy in life
was that he had been enabled to rescue hundreds
of lives, to bring light out of darkness, and
cheer and safety where before there had been
uncertainty and death. It is for this that the
name of Humphrey Davy will be blessed by
men and women in the ages still to come.</p>

<h2>SIR RICHARD ARKWRIGHT.</h2>
<hr class="l6" />

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Perhaps</span> no man has risen out of lower
depths of poverty and ignorance and obscurity
to the very top of fame&rsquo;s ladder than Richard
Arkwright. More than 150 years ago, towards
the end of December, 1732, there was born in
a house in a humble side street of Preston, a
child who was to leave his stamp, not only on
his native town, but on the whole of England,
and indeed on the civilisation of the world.</p>

<p>The son of poor parents, and, like Josiah
Wedgwood, the youngest of thirteen, it may be
that that Christmas held even less brightness than
usual for the struggling Arkwrights because of
the coming of an extra mouth to feed. At any
rate, if ever child were confronted by the chill
and dreary outlook on a cold world, that child
was the baby Richard.</p>

<p>Preston was not, 150 years ago, the Preston
of to-day. Then it was a town with a few
thousand inhabitants, &ldquo;beyond the trading part
of the county,&rdquo; while to-day it is in the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
centre of the cotton manufacture, hiving with
crowds of human beings&mdash;a great town because
here, in a squalid, insignificant by-street, one
bleak December day, there first saw the light
the man who was to &ldquo;give to England the
power of cotton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As there was scant enough money for food
and clothing in the Arkwright house, so it
followed that for schooling there was none at all.
Young Richard would have stood a poor chance
had it not been that his uncle Richard took pity
on the boy growing up in a state of neglect and
ignorance, and taught him to read. In later
days he added something to this small beginning
by attending classes in the winter evenings.
And so the early years of his life passed, and in
time the boy went out into the world, poorly
and scantily enough armed for its difficult battle.
Long years after he bemoaned his ignorance and
want of education when he felt all the drawbacks,
the trammelling, the holding-down of it, when
he realised how it handicapped him in the race
of life. And when he was an old man over
fifty, after pressing into the day as many as sixteen
working hours, he would steal an hour from
sleep to learn English grammar and another
hour to practise writing and spelling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>But, poorly equipped as young Richard was
in most ways, he went out into life provided
with a great brain, and had he known it, that
brain was to open to him a door through which&mdash;could
he have looked then&mdash;he might have
seen stretching away into the years a long vista
of triumphs and successes. The boy began on a
very low round of the ladder&mdash;a strange enough
beginning for the future maker of the cotton
world: he entered on his career as apprentice to
a barber. But, boy as he was, he threw himself
with energy and ardour&mdash;these two qualities that
made him a great man later on&mdash;into the new
business. He took a firm hold of it. He worked
steadily at it for years, having most likely
nothing in his mind higher than the setting up
for himself&mdash;the becoming some day a master
barber! It was this goal at that time that
seemed to him getting on in life.</p>

<p>So his boyhood sped away, and when his
apprenticeship had come to an end he took the
great and important step of setting up for himself.
He left Preston and went to Bolton. Poor
indeed must have been his stock of money at
this point in his fortunes. It was no imposing
shop he took, with windows and painted sign,
but the smallest and poorest place to be had.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
He rented an underground cellar, but his eager
spirit was to be damped neither by poverty nor
a dreary outlook. He bent all his powers on
getting customers, and as the first step to this
he stuck out a placard above his cellar door
with the scrawled invitation&mdash;</p>

<p class="placard">&ldquo;Come to the subterraneous barber, he shaves
for a penny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the little world of hair-dressing the rude
appeal made a small sensation. Here, as in
other businesses, there was competition. Arkwright
shaved for a penny. At this rate the
subterraneous barber would draw away the
customers of others! While the underground
cellar would be crowded, their shops would be
empty. And so they were forced to let down
their prices, and others besides Arkwright shaved
for a penny.</p>

<p>Young Richard, rising one morning, grasped
the fact that he was now not alone in his prices.
Others were running him dangerously close. He
was merely one of many now, but with the
enterprise that outdid others by-and-by in the
great world of mechanical invention he resolved
to strike out a bold new line. The old placard
was taken down and another printed and set up
in its stead.</p>

<p class="placard">&ldquo;A clean shave for a halfpenny!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>But Arkwright was not content to stand still
in shaving people&rsquo;s chins or in anything else.
These were the days of wearing wigs, and it
struck him that something was to be made out
of wigs, or perukes, as they were called, and so
he gave up his business of shaving in a measure
and began to travel about the country buying
and selling human hair. He regularly attended
country fairs and bought the locks and tresses
of the young girls who came there to be hired
out to service. In time he grew to make successful
bargains with these, and to add to this
he discovered a chemical dye, with which he
dyed the hair and sold it to wig-makers, and
by-and-by &ldquo;Arkwright&rsquo;s Hair&rdquo; came to be known
as the best in the market.</p>

<p>It most likely was&mdash;at any rate, it may have
been in those journeys&mdash;going in and out among
the houses and cottages in the country that he
came to be familiar with the sound of the
&ldquo;weaver&rsquo;s shuttle&rdquo; and the turning of the &ldquo;one-thread
machine.&rdquo; Long years after he was to
find that familiarity stand him in good stead.
But, successful and hard-working as he was, life
was still a struggle, and with all his efforts he
earned but a bare living. It was hard to wrest
a fortune from wig-making and chin-shaving, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
gradually there grew up in his busy brain a
project. It formed very slowly, but it did grow.
It was the genius within him struggling with
disadvantages and drawbacks that would have
&ldquo;posed&rdquo; most men. His mind, leaning strongly
to the mechanical, groped vaguely at first after
something, and then gradually it settled down
to the &ldquo;spinning machine,&rdquo; and from that time
onwards all his energies were bent on that.</p>

<p>In his journeys among the cottagers it had
been easy enough to see that the yarn could not
be made quickly enough for the weaver, that
though in thousands of cottages the &ldquo;one-thread
machine&rdquo; turned from morning till night and
again from night till morning, it could not keep
pace with the shuttle. What was wanted was a
dozen, fifty, a hundred threads to be made by a
single pair of hands. Did he perhaps see dimly
even then that he was to be the man who should
throw out the old-fashioned hand-wheel?</p>

<p>One day he noticed a red-hot bar of iron become
elongated as it passed between two iron
rollers. In that instant he first saw dimly the
tiny seedling that was to grow one day to the
mighty tree of the spinning-frame. The idea
lodged in his brain and took firm hold of him.</p>

<p>In outward appearance at this time Arkwright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
was in no way specially attractive or remarkable,
but genius is not always outwardly beautiful, and
&ldquo;there were notions in that rough head of his&rdquo;
that were one day to alter England.</p>

<p>But Arkwright was no practical mechanic, and
so he called in help from outside&mdash;from one
Kay, a clockmaker in Warrington, and under his
directions Kay made rollers and wheels, and
shortly Arkwright had his models ready to hand.
Meantime, while his heart beat high with hope
and exultation, his pet models being always in
his mind though for bread and butter he still
made wigs and shaved chins, he received a
sudden and unexpected check. His wife&mdash;for he
was already married&mdash;chafing in secret over
what she considered his fantastic imaginings and
idle dreamings, made up her mind to destroy
that which distracted his mind from the business
of shaving and money-making. As the surest
means to her end she burned his models one
day when he was out of the way. Poor Arkwright
returned and discovered the mischief. In
an instant his whole stubborn nature was up in
arms. Indeed, so wrathful was he that he would
from that day have nothing more to do with his
wife, and the two separated.</p>

<p>And now the great question was&mdash;how best to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
push the new model Kay had made. Poverty
handicapped him sadly. It was impossible to
push anything without money. He cast about
in his mind where the money was to come from,
and settled on an old friend in Preston, &ldquo;a
liquor merchant and painter&rdquo; (probably a house-painter).
To Preston he took his way. The
friend consented to help him, and together with
high hopes and great rejoicing he and Kay set
up their model. But their secrecy had roused
suspicion. Behind this friend&rsquo;s house there
happened to be a closed-in garden with a number
of gooseberry bushes. Close by in a neighbouring
cottage lived two old ladies. At nights they
declared they heard a strange humming noise
among the bushes, as if the devil himself were
making music, tuning up his bagpipes for Arkwright
and Kay to dance a reel! The story got
abroad. The people of Preston, excited and
curious, were eager to break into the house and
discover if Arkwright and Kay were indeed in
league with the Evil One.</p>

<p>But after the model had been set up and was
about to be shown in the Free Grammar School
in Preston, there came a sudden memory of
dark stories still fresh in men&rsquo;s minds of how
other inventors had been treated in Preston&mdash;how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
they had been mobbed and furiously ill-used,
while their inventions had been smashed
to atoms by a people panic-stricken because of
their dread of machinery, which they believed
would throw them out of work and take the
bread out of their and their children&rsquo;s mouths.
Arkwright remembered all this, and he and Kay
finally made up their minds to pack up their
models and set off for Nottingham.</p>

<p>While Arkwright had been at Preston engrossed
with thoughts of his model a political
election took place, and he was called upon to
vote. But so poor and so wretchedly clad was
the man who was by-and-by to be a knight&mdash;the
man who was to leave behind him half a million&mdash;that
before he could present himself at the poll,
several people had to club together to exchange
the tattered garments for something that would
at least be presentable!</p>

<p>Arrived at Nottingham, Arkwright tried to
get someone to help him with money. This
brave man had firm faith in his invention and
firm faith in himself. It was simply impossible
to discourage him. But the time of waiting
was long and weary before he fell in with a
Mr. Strutt, the inventor of the stocking-frame.
An inventor himself, perhaps he was the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
who could best understand and appreciate
Arkwright&rsquo;s invention. The two entered into
partnership, and it may have seemed to Arkwright
that his time of trial and waiting had at
last come to an end.</p>

<p>And now truly enough he had his foot firmly
planted on the ladder of success. Behind him
was a hard and toilsome boyhood. Before him
were still long waiting, difficulties to face, men&rsquo;s
opposition to overcome, dislike, distrust, envy,
and jealousy to live down and conquer. But
the first step had been taken, and never once
along the difficult way do we find him flinch.</p>

<p>In 1769, the same year in which James Watt
patented his Condensing Steam Engine, Arkwright
at the age of thirty-seven took out the
patent for his Spinning-Frame. His next step
was to erect a cotton mill at Chorley, and
following that, one at Cromford, in Derbyshire.
No sooner were they finished than men flocked
from Lancashire, and indeed from all parts of
England, to see them at work. They were the
gazing-stock of the country.</p>

<p>But Arkwright&rsquo;s brain was not the only one
that had pondered on cardings and rollers and
wheels and spindles, and soon there sprang up
men who said this invention was not all his.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
He had taken other men&rsquo;s thoughts and adapted
them, and joined them together, and called the
whole his own. And now there followed hard
years of opposition, fightings, struggles, before
which a weaker man than Arkwright would
have gone down. But nothing discouraged or
defeated him. Not even five years of weary
waiting, an expenditure of 12,000, and yet
no profit from his invention! His brave spirit
was still undaunted. Men did not try to
hide their envy and jealousy. They fell upon
his mill at Chorley in mobs of hundreds. A
strong force of police, and even of the military,
was called out to quell the rioters. Two of
them were shot dead, one was drowned, and
several were wounded; while the rest smashed
every machine they could lay hands on, everything
that was worked by horse-power or by
water-power, sparing only and alone what
human hands could undertake. And it was not
the workmen only who, with blind or short-sighted
eyes, looked on machinery as a curse,
believing that it would rob them of their living,
but the better, more enlightened classes as well,
who regarded Arkwright as an enemy to mankind.
They were doubtless at the same time
looking to their pockets. If working men were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
thrown out of work, it meant that <em>they</em> would
have larger poor rates to pay, and so they too
fell upon Arkwright, not seeing that here was
the man ready and anxious, if they would but
listen to him, to give thousands of people work
where now instead only hundreds had it.</p>

<p>Meantime he faced his opponents, showing
always a brave front, and trying to defend
himself at every point. He endured the spoiling
of his property, and then, not content with
browbeating him, they seized upon his patent
rights and disputed them. And the upshot was
that Arkwright&rsquo;s patent was set aside by Parliament.
But even then the great inventor was
not overwhelmed. Passing by the hotel where
some of his enemies were standing after his
defeat, he overheard one say to another&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we have done for the old shaver at
last.&rdquo; Arkwright turned round, ready, cool, immovable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have a razor left
in Scotland that will shave you all yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had first tried horse-power for his mills.
Now he was trying water-power, and he foresaw
that Lanark, in Scotland, so well situated on
the Clyde for his purpose, would furnish him
with all that was wanted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Meantime, cotton was gradually growing to a
great industry in England. People who had
looked suspiciously and enviously on Arkwright
at first now reluctantly admitted that his goods
were the best to be had, and by-and-by it
was he who fixed the prices in the market.
It was as if by his own efforts he had created
a little world. The originality of each part
of his invention, may not entirely have been
his. This part or that&mdash;a roller, a carding, a
crank, a spindle&mdash;one of these may have belonged
to some other man, but to Arkwright
belongs the joining of all together. It was his
master mind that collected under one roof the
whole series of machines, from the engine that
received the cotton-wool, much as it came from
the pod, to that which wound it in bobbins&mdash;a
hard and firm cotton-yarn. It was he who
made each thing dovetail into the other, who
worked out the one perfect, harmonious whole.
His, too, was the strong mind that trained men
and boys&mdash;never before used to machinery&mdash;to
its irksomeness, its regularity, its exactitude,
taking them from idle, desultory lives, it might
be, and accustoming them to system and discipline.
In the old days the slow sale of the
yarn and the stupidity of workmen had sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
almost daunted him, but these days were
past.</p>

<p>And how the man worked!&mdash;with a quick,
all-grasping mind. It was the boy over again
in his underground cellar, unwilling to be worsted
in his &ldquo;penny a shave,&rdquo; striking out the bold
line of a halfpenny one. Riches from his
machines&mdash;and even more from his mills&mdash;flowed
in upon him. He was a man of no
small account now. England had come to
identify the name of Arkwright with an open
door to a great source of wealth for the land.
King George&nbsp;III. knighted him, and a year later
he was made High Sheriff of Derbyshire. But
still he went on working, managing, superintending
his mills and his machinery&mdash;leading a life
of sacrifice. As he had done when a boy, so
still as a man, he made the very most of his
time, even grudging that spent on a journey,
and generally travelling with four horses in
order to overtake it quickly. He who had
lived as a boy in an underground cellar, now
occupied a magnificent mansion, and was a man
of note in the county and in England. But
we remember, and not without sadness, how
for long in the midst of his hard work he was
a victim to bodily suffering&mdash;subject to severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
asthma&mdash;and how bravely and uncomplainingly
he bore up and struggled on in spite of all!
Now, already early&mdash;while he was but in his
sixtieth year&mdash;he began to fail. Asthma was
complicated with other disorders. There were,
too, the strain and stress of a life of hard work,
and these reached a climax while the great man
was still in the zenith of his mental powers, and
he passed away on the 3rd August, 1792.</p>

<p>Arkwright&rsquo;s name was now of world-wide
fame. Hundreds and thousands of people, many
of whom had come to see his first cotton-mill,
crowded the rocks and roads about Cromford,
and mingled with the long procession that bore
the body of the great inventor to his last resting-place.</p>

<p>They erected a monument in the church of
Cromford to his memory. But the name of
Arkwright needs no carved memorial of stone.
His memorial is of a more lasting kind, for it is
he whom England has to thank to-day for an
industry that has enriched the land. Not
&ldquo;proud Preston&rdquo; alone&mdash;a small town at his
birth, a mighty place of manufacture now&mdash;has
Arkwright made to grow and flourish.</p>

<p>He was a man of &ldquo;Napoleon nerve.&rdquo; Where
other men saw but a short way ahead, he grasped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the end from the beginning; where other minds
saw merely a part, his eye was able to take in
the whole. He may have gathered up some
threads from other men&rsquo;s brains, but it was
he who wove them into one great whole. He
had a business faculty&mdash;he had shown it as a
boy&mdash;that rose almost to the height of genius.
And he believed in himself. He had great
notions, great ambitions. Nothing was too big
a project for him to attempt. And success was
his&mdash;great success, as the world counts it. Immense
riches, too, were his, for when he died
he left behind him half a million. But to us
that seems not of so much account as that that
great mind of his was the first to grasp what
was to put within their reach a source of riches
and profit to thousands of working-people in
England, and this in face of bitter opposition
from the people themselves. He braved their
jealousy, he held his own against their prejudices
and attacks, and working often in bodily weakness
and pain, but with persevering determination,

<h2>JOSIAH WEDGWOOD.</h2>
<hr class="l6" />

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">When</span> Josiah Wedgwood was born, some
170 years ago, I daresay the people of the
little village of Burslem would have been greatly
astonished had they been told that the humble
potter&rsquo;s child was by-and-by to change the
place, with its few straggling houses, into a
flourishing town with thousands of inhabitants.
And not this alone, but that he would make
for himself such fame that his name should be
a household word throughout Great Britain, and
indeed throughout the world.</p>

<p>When Josiah came into the world there was
already a small army of brothers and sisters
awaiting him in the humble little house close
by the churchyard of Burslem, for he was the
youngest of thirteen.</p>

<p>Although then large towns and places near
the sea were marching on with the progress of
civilisation, little country places buried inland
were shunted into a siding, as it were, and so
were left far behind the great world. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
way the midland counties of England were a
long time emerging from the darkness of the
Middle Ages. Staffordshire, the county of pottery,
lagged a long way behind in improvements.
Its villages were straggling and dirty.
Its houses little better than thatched hovels or
mud huts. Heaps of waste and dirt and
rubbish blocked their doorways. Broken ware
was scattered everywhere. Hollows in the
ground, where clay had been scooped out to
make ware, gaped close to the doorways, and
collected great pools of evil-smelling stagnant
water.</p>

<p>Burslem was in something of this sorry state
when Josiah Wedgwood opened his eyes on the
world. The people of the village for the most
part had been potters for upwards of 200 years.
That is, they made pots and butter-dishes and
porringers&mdash;for spoons and plates were still
of wood&mdash;out of the clay of which their
soil was made; not fine and polished and
gleaming white, as we know them to-day, but
rough-hewn things, for the trade of pottery was
yet in its infancy.</p>

<p>A potter&rsquo;s work could be divided among one
family. The father and sons made and fired the
dishes. The mother and daughters strapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
them on the backs of horses and donkeys,
driving them along roads so wretched that the
poor beasts often stuck in the mud or fell down
in the ruts, while the women, with pipes in
their mouths and rough words on their lips,
urged them on with whip and lash.</p>

<p>It was this sort of life that lay before Josiah.
But he had been born with a boy&rsquo;s best blessing&mdash;a
good mother&mdash;a woman who had a heart
large enough for thirteen children, and who
tried what she could to hand down to them by
example a birthright better than riches&mdash;to make
them patient, industrious, dependent on self.</p>

<p>When the child was little more than a baby,
and able only to toddle with uncertain step, he
was sent to a dame&rsquo;s school, quite as much to be
out of the way as to learn his A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C. For the
rest he played about the door of the cottage, his
greatest treat to bestride the pack-horse&rsquo;s back,
hoisted up by some good-natured packman.
When he was seven years old he was sent to
school to a place called Newcastle-under-Lyme,
some three and a half miles across the fields.
In long days of sunshine the walk was full of
pleasure to the boy, as he came to know
Nature&rsquo;s beauties&mdash;her birds and flowers and
sweet fragrances&mdash;as we best can know things, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
close and loving intimacy. Long years afterwards,
when he had reached the highest heights
of his trade, it was the unforgotten faces of the
wild flowers lurking in the fields between Newcastle
and Burslem that rose before his mind&rsquo;s
eye as he decorated his china services with
coloured leaves and flowers.</p>

<p>When Josiah was nine years old his father
died, and the mother was left to struggle with
her thirteen as best she could. Nor do we find
that she failed. She was a woman with a large,
loving heart, that rarely quailed before stress or
struggle. The old potter had not been able out
of his hard-won earnings to leave to his children
much&mdash;20 when they reached the age of
twenty-one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; as Josiah used to say long afterwards,
&ldquo;I began on the very lowest round of the
ladder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now the child&rsquo;s scanty schooling had
come to an end. He could write and he could
read, and he knew something of the mysteries of
arithmetic, but for the rest&mdash;that great storehouse
of knowledge the world contained&mdash;he had
to unlock the door of <em>that</em> for himself, and he
did it patiently, often in weariness and pain and
suffering, as the years went on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>To his eldest son Thomas the father had left
the pottery, and now it fell to him to act as father
to the family. Josiah, as a matter of course,
went into the business, beginning, I suppose, at
the humble post of turning what was called &ldquo;the
potter&rsquo;s wheel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a wheel with a strap round it attached
to a disc that revolved horizontally and beside
which sat a man called &ldquo;a thrower,&rdquo; shaping
with his fingers and hands the moist clay that
was to form a bowl or plate or whatever vessel
was to be made, copying a pattern in front of
him.</p>

<p>The boy worked steadily, but hardly had he
reached the stage of &ldquo;thrower,&rdquo; hardly had
people noted and admired the wonderful deftness
with which the boyish hands moulded and
shaped the clay, when a cloud descended and
settled on his life&mdash;a cloud that, though he
struggled bravely against its depression all
through life, never entirely lifted.</p>

<p>The terrible epidemic of small-pox visited
Burslem, and the Wedgwood family, living as
they did on the edge of the churchyard, were
among the first to take it, the youngest so badly
that his life was despaired of. However, after
long struggle, they pulled him through; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
disease left behind it a knee which gave him
hours and days of excruciating pain, and seemed
almost as if it would blight his whole life and
ruin his career. Every remedy was tried, in vain.
At first when he rose in bed, weak and unstrung,
he fell back again. When later he began to
stand it was with weariness and pain. But the
dark cloud had, though all unseen at first, a silver
lining. Out of what looked a great calamity
there sprang good. The boy when he crawled
back to work was no longer fit for the &ldquo;thrower&rsquo;s&rdquo;
bench. The position he had now to take&mdash;with
his leg stretched out in front of him&mdash;cramped
and impeded him. No longer active and able-bodied,
he was thrown, as it were, in upon himself,
and so took to thinking&mdash;not in a gloomy,
despondent way, but thinking how best he could
improve himself, how best he could succeed in
that calling that from the very outset held a
charm for him and all through life lay very near
to his heart.</p>

<p>At the age of fourteen Josiah was formally
bound apprentice to his brother. Here is the
form. The quaint words sound ceremonious&mdash;almost
solemn. The writing provided that he
was&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To learn the Art, Mystery, Occupation or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Imployment of throwing and handling which he,
the said Thomas Wedgwood, now useth, and with
him as an apprentice to dwell, continue and
serve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An apprentice in those days at the pottery
works was allowed &ldquo;his meat, drink, washing and
lodging, with suitable apparel of all kinds, both
linen and woollen and all other necessaries, both
in sickness and in health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In return the master &ldquo;was to teach or cause
to be taught the art of throwing and handling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How poor these potters were, and how poorly
they paid their apprentices, may be gathered
from this:</p>

<p>For the first three years he got 1<i>s.</i> a week,
for the second three years he got 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a week,
and for the seventh and last 4<i>s.</i> a week.
Besides this he got, once a year, a pair of shoes.
At the end of his apprenticeship, if he chose, he
got 5<i>s.</i> a week for five years. It was a dreary
enough outlook for an eager, ambitious boy
anxious to make his way in the world.</p>

<p>But boy though he was, the difficulty of
getting on&mdash;pain, weakness&mdash;none of these
obstacles were allowed to overcome Josiah.
Then even at that early age he showed the
germs of that perseverance that stood out so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
strongly by-and-by in the character of the
man.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem to us, what sounds the
very common business of making rough earthenware
milk-bowls and butter-pots and plates was
often half shrouded in mystery, and went near
to being something of a secret.</p>

<p>Pottery was yet in its beginnings&mdash;not yet an
art&mdash;and it could only grow and come to perfection
by someone giving to it deep thought
and long, patient, painstaking experiments. For
instance, one man might pore over the matter
and discover something new or come to some
conclusion. He might find one substance, a
clay or a soil, that when mixed with a second
substance produced a third thing&mdash;something
new. He might begin to work this out in his
pottery, and immediately all the workmen in the
place knew the secret of how he did it. The
knowledge spread, and while he believed it was
still all his own, other men had seized on his
discovery; other potteries were turning out his
ware and selling it.</p>

<p>So keen were men to find out the discoveries
of other men, and so closely have these secrets
been kept, that sometimes a master would prefer
to employ idiots, when he could get them, to turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
his wheel. If one workman appeared more skilled
than the others he was shut up while at work.
The door was locked, the windows were blinded,
and when he came out he was carefully searched.
Men have been known to pretend to be idiots
just that they might get inside a noted pottery;
even to put up with kicks and blows for their
stupidity; to make intentional mistakes to encourage
the falsehood; to hold on to this
perhaps as long as two whole years; while
night after night they crept home and there
wrote down carefully every item of what they
had seen, and so made the secrets their own.</p>

<p>In Josiah&rsquo;s boyhood there was much of this
sort of thing carried on. A strict secrecy&mdash;a
protection of themselves&mdash;as merchant vessels
on the high seas in olden days guarded themselves
from the pirates who, ready to pounce
upon them, roamed the waters.</p>

<p>But as a man&mdash;a great, large-hearted, open-minded
man&mdash;and one of the greatest inventors
of his time, Wedgwood never followed this line
of action. Rather was he nobly willing that
others should be the better for his brains. And
so during his long life he took out only one
patent, as we call that which makes an invention
all a man&rsquo;s own and prevents others touching it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>At the time we write of there was just beginning
to dawn on Josiah&rsquo;s boyish mind what was
by-and-by to raise him to the very top of his
calling.</p>

<p>He took to pondering and considering and
making experiments with the clay that lay
about the doors. How to make the black
mottled ware more delicate&mdash;the ruddy-coloured
of a fairer hue&mdash;how to mould rough edges more
smoothly&mdash;how to introduce fresh colours and
glazes.</p>

<p>The whole thing threw over the boy a great
glamour of fascination. They show in Burslem
yet a teapot&mdash;an ornamented thing made of the
ochreous clay of the district&mdash;as &ldquo;Josiah Wedgwood&rsquo;s
first teapot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the elder brother, brought up to the cut-and-dried
routine of the potteries life, had little
patience with what he looked on as the younger&rsquo;s
shiftless dreamings. He had brothers and
sisters to keep, and money to make, and if
Josiah were not more practical he wanted him
no longer.</p>

<p>And so the honest but short-sighted brother,
his eyes blinded by the present need of ready
money, failed to realise that there was something
greater, and that the young brother would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
one day leave him and his plodding ways far
behind.</p>

<p>But while his brother looked upon the boy as
an unpractical dreamer, there were others in
Burslem who saw the beauty of the patient, uncomplaining,
steadfast life, and more than one
father in the place called on his sons to take a
pattern from Josiah Wedgwood.</p>

<p>But in the midst of his patient inquiries, and
while he was yet little more than a boy, a swift
blow descended upon the Wedgwoods. The
mother who had for so long been father and
mother in one to them was taken from them.
They laid her in the quiet little church of
Burslem, and the brothers and sisters went on
living together.</p>

<p>It was not till he had reached the age of
twenty-two that Josiah cut the knot that bound
him to home and went out into the great world
to seek his fortune, as eager youths will do to
the end of time. He took with him his little all&mdash;his
father&rsquo;s legacy of 20, a pair of capable
hands, and a wonderful brain.</p>

<p>His boyhood was over. Manhood lay before
him&mdash;rough places at first in the world, puzzles,
difficulties, trials, but in the end name, fame,
riches. If we could follow him past boyhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and just peep at the future, I should like to tell
you how he let some of these fancies his brother
had despised have free play; how he invented a
new green earthenware, forming plates in the
shape of ornamental leaves; how he coloured
snuff-boxes and toilet vessels to imitate precious
stones, and how the London jewellers eagerly
bought these up. How he made flowered cups
and saucers, familiar enough to us to-day, but
strange and beautiful to people then. Under
him things took a step forward. People even at
their meals saw things of beauty. These became
an education to them&mdash;an art. Besides this they
found other improvements. Lids fitted, spouts
poured, handles could be held! These were small
beginnings, but from these Josiah made great
strides.</p>

<p>And one of the secrets of these strides was
that he bent his <em>whole mind</em> upon his work. At
night, after a day of hard work, he would sit
down and write out every smallest detail of his
experiments and discoveries. No pains were too
great for him to take. Neither would he trust
to memory, so often in pain and weariness, but
with a perseverance that was never daunted, he
would make his evening notes.</p>

<p>To him no trouble seemed too great, no detail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
too small. The boyhood rarely fails to show the
stuff the man is made of, and it was no ordinary
stuff the great potter was made of. So we are
not surprised that step by step he moved upwards
and onwards. Hands and brain were
never idle. Often prostrate with pain and weakness,
he would still read and think and plan.
Indeed, so much did he get into the habit of
planning that many a night it robbed him of his
sleep, for he never lay down at nights without
making in his head a programme for the coming
day.</p>

<p>Another secret of his success was his courage.
Was it long familiarity with pain&mdash;for his knee
broke out again and again, and gave him weary
hours of suffering&mdash;that taught him to endure
and resolutely refuse to be overcome? Was it
this made him say with Napoleon, &ldquo;Nothing is
impossible&rdquo;?</p>

<p>He met all difficulties alike with patience and
with a steadfast purpose to overcome them. He
had two special ones. His workmen&mdash;often lazy,
indolent, drunken&mdash;were a trouble to him, as
were also the furnaces, where the heat had to be
of a certain degree to fire his ware, and where
sometimes the work and labour of months would
be destroyed in a few hours. By patience he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
won the hearts of the first, and they came to
trust him, and by patience, too, he gradually
righted the second. He pulled down and he
built up till the kilns were right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be done,&rdquo; he used to say of any
difficult enterprise, &ldquo;let what may stand in the
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had great ambition for his beloved calling.
He wanted to make it an art. England had
been long famed for cheapness but not for
beauty, and so he set himself to study the
designs of the ancients and of the Greeks,
copying them on china and porcelain.</p>

<p>And yet it seemed that even as he took step
after step there were ever on each round of the
ladder new difficulties. There was a long-standing
one&mdash;the wretched state of the roads in
Staffordshire, and the difficulty of getting the
ware carried to other places for sale, and of
getting necessaries for the work brought into
the county.</p>

<p>The backs of horses and donkeys, these were
the only mode of conveyance&mdash;miserable underfed
creatures that tottered and stumbled along and
not seldom stuck in the muddy lanes or fell in
the ruts and rugged roads, and often broke their
legs and their wares, and had to be shot where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
they lay&mdash;a happy release for the poor animals.
Josiah saw all this, and realised that something
must be done to remedy the evil. So in the
midst of his watchful care and constant thought
for his beloved potteries he made time to push
the grand scheme of a canal that began gradually
to see daylight. It was not pack-horses that
would labour slowly to Birmingham and Sheffield,
but a broad waterway to carry goods to Liverpool
and other seaports. This was what his native
county wanted. And so he subscribed largely
to this, and helped to push a Bill through
Parliament.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I scarcely know,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;whether I am
a landed gentleman, an engineer, or a potter,
for indeed I am all three and many other
characters by turns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In time Burslem, to which he had come back
after absence, could hold him no longer, so he
bought a place near and called it Etruria,
because for long he had admired the beautiful
work of the Etruscans away north of the Tiber
in Italy.</p>

<p>By his wonderful enterprise he made this
bare place blooming and fruitful, and from a
lonely wilderness converted it into a place with
thousands of flourishing houses and workmen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
And he himself was the mainspring of it all&mdash;the
moving spirit.</p>

<p>Now the inventions of his brain were selling
all over the country, and indeed all over the
world. His delicate china had attracted the
notice of the Queen&mdash;Charlotte, the wife of
George&nbsp;III. It was the full development of
that &ldquo;cream&rdquo; ware whose first beginnings had
dawned on his brain as a boy. She ordered
a set of it, and henceforth it was known
the &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Ware,&rdquo; and she sent to Josiah
Wedgwood and said he might call himself
&ldquo;Potter to the Queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now his name was made, and soon a
fortune followed. He discovered a &ldquo;jasper dip,&rdquo;
and he invented a special kind of ware of which
he made vases, and for a time it seemed as if
the country went mad for Wedgwood&rsquo;s vases.
&ldquo;A violent vase mania,&rdquo; he called it himself.
The mania spread to Ireland and the Continent.
Before this he had opened showrooms in London,
and the Wedgwood vases were wont to draw
crowds as great as the pictures in the Royal
Academy. Nor did he confine himself to vases.
He made portraits in china of great men, and
fashioned beautiful chimney-pieces. His heart
went out in burning indignation against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
curse of slavery, and he produced a model of
a negro chained in a supplicating attitude, with
this motto round the figure: &ldquo;Am I not a Man
and a Brother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now he had made his fortune, but the man
remained the same, much as he had been as a
boy&mdash;hard-working, conscientious, painstaking.
As a grand foundation to all his work he had
made the surface of the earth a mighty study,
and when he died he left 7,000 specimens of
soils and clays labelled and classified.</p>

<p>Even when rich and famous he still took
minute note of details. He would visit each
department of his works himself. He would
have nothing &ldquo;scamped.&rdquo; Well did the workmen
know the &ldquo;thud&rdquo; of his wooden leg on the
floor that announced his coming, and with his
stick he would break any article he did not
think perfect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do for Josiah Wedgwood!&rdquo; he
would say.</p>

<p>As life advanced, while it brought him joys,
it brought him also clouds and sorrows. His
knee grew so tormenting that he was forced to
have it taken off. After this he used a wooden
leg, or rather many wooden legs, for he was
very particular about having it often renewed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Partial blindness attacked him, general ill-health,
but his pluck, his perseverance never
failed.</p>

<p>As he withdrew a little from active life he
took to gardening, but his family noted his
failing powers&mdash;not of mind, but of body.
Asthma was added to his other sufferings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am becoming an old man,&rdquo; he wrote.
&ldquo;Age and infirmity overtake me, and more than
whisper in my ear that it is time to diminish
rather than increase the objects of my attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The end came very suddenly, and while he
was yet not old. A pain in his jaw was the
beginning. Fever and insensibility followed,
and in his sixty-fifth year Josiah Wedgwood
closed his eyes on a world that he left the
better for his passage through it.</p>

<p>He had scaled the ladder to its highest height.
He was born in a humble potter&rsquo;s cottage. He
died in a mansion, surrounded by a population
he had gathered together and made to flourish.
He left half a million, but he had used his
riches well. He had given of them to suffering
and distress. He made a poor depressed trade
into one of the flourishing industries of Great
Britain, and for himself a world-wide name.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
He was a great pioneer, and he accepted with
patience the difficulties, the thanklessness, the
buffetings that confront the man who in anything
attempts the first beginning.</p>

<p>But while we admire his splendid qualities,
it is the singular beauty of his nature&mdash;a nature
doubtless softened and sweetened by trial&mdash;his
uncomplaining bravery, his thought for others,
his simple, steadfast determination to carry
through his life-work, in spite of the burden of
weariness and sickness and bodily pain, that
most of all speak to our hearts.</p>

<h2>GEORGE STEPHENSON.</h2>
<hr class="l6" />

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">If</span> a town, or even a village, is of any importance
nowadays it is sure to have within it
or alongside it a railway station, a place that
brings it into touch with the great outside world.
Some seventy-five years ago there were no
railways or railway-stations in Great Britain, or
anywhere else, and people were content to post
or coach along roads behind horses. But now
times are changed, and it is not wonderful that
the name of George Stephenson, the man who
has opened up the country and spread lines upon
it like a mighty network, is a name to-day that
people look up to as one of the greatest inventors
the world has ever known.</p>

<p>Most of us are fond of seeing the small beginnings
of great endings, so it is natural enough
that for us the tiny village of Wylam should be
of deepest interest, for here George Stephenson
first saw the light.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_104.jpg" width="389" height="630" alt="&ldquo;Stephenson fighting the fire in Killingworth Colliery.&rdquo;" title="" />
<br /><span class="caption">&ldquo;Stephenson fighting the fire in Killingworth Colliery.&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>We cannot visit Wylam without feeling at
once that we are in the heart of the colliery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
country. Newcastle&rsquo;s lofty chimneys tower some
eight miles off, and chimneys closer at hand
belch forth great volumes of smoke and smut,
and flaming furnaces shoot out lurid lights by
night far across the country.</p>

<p>In a common little wayside house, just a
labourer&rsquo;s cottage, standing on the roadside, some
120 years ago a baby opened his eyes on a
world that was to be rough enough at first for
his young feet, though at last they were to land
on the very topmost round of the ladder.</p>

<p>The second child of the fireman of the old
pumping-engine of the colliery of Wylam, little
George was born to grinding poverty. Time as
it passed brought other children besides George
to the Stephensons, and soon it came to be a
question how the fireman and his wife and six
children were to live on 12<i>s.</i> a week!</p>

<p>It was indeed a problem to solve and a
struggle to face. When food had been got for
the little mouths, what was left for clothes and
schooling? Very little for the first, nothing for
the second. No schooling certainly for little
George, and so he spent his childhood between
running errands for his mother and standing by
his father&rsquo;s engine fire, where the boys and girls
of the village loved to gather to listen to old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Robert&rsquo;s wondrous tales, or to see the birds fed,
for the old man loved birds of all kinds, and
would save the crumbs from his own scant dinner
to feed the robins. Here it was that baby
George learned that early love of birds that
lasted as long as life. As a boy he would catch
and tame the blackbirds, and these would fly
about the cottage all day, and at night come
and roost at his bed-head. Years after, when he
was an old man, he used to tell how, walking
with his father one day, he parted some thick
branches overhead and lifted the child in his
arms that he might peep at a nest full of young
blackbirds. It was a sight he never forgot.</p>

<p>But, baby though he was, his days were not
all spent in play. At home there were seven
younger brothers and sisters to be nursed and
watched and kept out of the way of the heavy
waggons that were dragged by horses along the
tram-road in front of the house, and much of
this fell to George&rsquo;s share.</p>

<p>As the years passed the Stephenson family,
obliged like other colliers &ldquo;to follow the work,&rdquo;
moved to a place called Dewley Burn, and now
as George had reached the age of eight he was
ready to earn some money!</p>

<p>To show how smart and quick the child was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
for his years there has come down to us a pretty
story.</p>

<p>He and his sister Nell had gone to Newcastle
one day, and among their little commissions
they were bent on buying Nell a new bonnet.
They found the very thing she wanted in a
shop, but the price was beyond their purse. It
was 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> over the mark, and the pair, sadly
downcast, had to leave the shop. Standing
crestfallen outside the boy suddenly exclaimed,
&ldquo;I have it! Wait here till I come back.&rdquo; Off
he darted, and Nell waited while the minutes
wore to hours, and still he did not come. Just
as she began to think he must either have
been killed or run over he dashed up breathless
and thrust the coveted 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> into her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where did you get it?&rdquo; she asked, astonished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By holding gentlemen&rsquo;s horses,&rdquo; was the
reply.</p>

<p>The child&rsquo;s first situation at this time was
with a woman who kept a farm and needed a
boy to herd her cows and keep them out of the
way of passing waggons. For this the little
herd-boy was paid 2<i>d.</i> a day. How happy
he was in long leisure hours to bird&rsquo;s-nest or
whittle whistles out of reeds, or in company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
with another boy&mdash;by-and-by, like himself, to be
one of the world&rsquo;s great engineers&mdash;to model toy
engines out of clay, using hollowed corks for
corves and hemlock stalks for steam pipes!</p>

<p>Soon George advanced a step in life. His
work was still farm-work&mdash;hoeing turnips for
4<i>d.</i> a day, leading the plough horses when his
little legs could hardly stride the furrows, and
working in the dawning hours of day when
other children slept.</p>

<p>But his heart was really at the engine fire or
in the coal shaft. It was &ldquo;bred in the bone,&rdquo;
and he gladly returned to the black, grimy life,
and along with his brother became a coal-picker,
separating stones and dross from the coal, and
so earning 6<i>d.</i> a day.</p>

<p>By-and-by he was advanced to driving &ldquo;the
gin-horse,&rdquo; a horse that travels round and round
at the pit&rsquo;s mouth drawing up and letting down
by means of a rope wound round a drum,
baskets of coal or buckets of water, and for this
he was paid 8<i>d.</i> a day.</p>

<p>Long miles he had to walk every day to and
from his work, &ldquo;a grit-growing lad, with bare
legs and feet,&rdquo; and I think we may be sure there
was not a bird&rsquo;s nest on that familiar road that
the little bird-lover did not know by heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>His next rise was to a shilling a day. This
was a great step up, and for this he had what
was called a night shift, lading and unlading
the coals as they came to the mouth of the pit,
and reversing the rope to go down again.
Monotonous enough work it was, but he held on
to it for two years. And now another step up
was at hand. It was a proud day for the boy&mdash;that
Saturday afternoon when he was told that
his wage had been raised to 12<i>s.</i> a week!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a made man now,&rdquo; he exclaimed in
great delight.</p>

<p>And now he was seventeen years old. He
had really stepped beyond his father both in
wage and position. But there was one thing
which he had yet to master. It may seem
strange to us, but George could neither read
nor write. It began to dawn upon him then
that things about which he wanted to know&mdash;pumps
and engines and the great world of
mechanics&mdash;could only be learned from between
the boards of books that were closed to him.
But with George to realise an evil was to try
at once to mend it. Inside the boy&rsquo;s rough
working jacket there beat a manly heart, with a
great longing to make the most of his opportunities,
to let no chance slip of doing his best.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>So he actually went to school at nights&mdash;three
times a week, spending 3<i>d.</i> out of his wages to
be taught to read and write. He laboured on
and made progress, and in time he wrote and
read, and by-and-by he took another step and
added to these arithmetic. With marvellous
quickness he &ldquo;caught on&rdquo; to figures. In the
long weary night shifts sitting by the blaze of
the fire he would &ldquo;work&rdquo; the sums his master
had &ldquo;set&rdquo; him or write his copies, just as years
after, so eager was he to seize every opportunity
that offered, he would many a time (in odd
moments) chalk his sums on the sides of the
coal waggons!</p>

<p>So little by little, by untiring labour and unwearied
industry, by &ldquo;neglecting nothing,&rdquo; he
rose. The miners who were his daily companions
were, many of them, a rough lot.
Their life was a hard one and their pleasures
few, and on Saturday afternoons&mdash;pay-day&mdash;their
amusements were cock-fighting, dog-fighting,
and drinking in the ale-house, while the
future great engineer might be found engaged in
pulling to pieces his engine, cleaning it, getting
to know it as we know the character, the habits,
the face of our dearest friend, all the time
laying in such a store of practical knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
as was to serve him in good stead in time to
come.</p>

<p>Not that George did not delight in exercise.
Indeed, few of his companions could equal him
in athletics. There was nothing he enjoyed like
challenging them to feats of strength in throwing
the hammer or in lifting heavy weights. And
even in comparative old age he loved to engage
in a wrestle with a friend.</p>

<p>About this time George had a favourite dog
which he taught to fetch and carry his dinner in
a pitcher tied round his neck. At the appointed
hour the creature used to go straight to his
master, turning neither to the right nor to the
left. But one day he was beset with danger in
the shape of a bigger dog with murder in its
eye. George&rsquo;s dog closed with it, and a deadly
tussle began, but it beat the bully and came off
victorious but bleeding. When he reached his
master the pitcher was there, but the dinner was
spilt; but George was prouder far, when an onlooker
described the fight, of his dog&rsquo;s courage
than he would have been of the most sumptuous
feast.</p>

<p>But in spite of his larger wage money was
scarce, and George beat about in his own mind
how he was to earn a few extra shillings. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
keen eye ever on the outlook for what lay
nearest, he lighted on the <em>shoes</em> of his fellow-workmen!
He took to mending these, and he
mended them so well that the pitmen soon got
into the way of making George their cobbler.
And from this he went on to making shoe-lasts
for the village shoemaker. In this way it came
to pass that in a fortnight&rsquo;s time he would sometimes
make as much as 2. When he had by
long and careful labour saved his first guinea
great was his delight. &ldquo;I am now a rich man!&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>Yet another source of earning money was at
hand. One day the chimney of his house went
on fire, and being drenched with water, the soot
and water together succeeded in damaging an
eight-day clock that stood in his kitchen. Money
was still scarce, and the watchmaker did not
work without pay, so George set to work and
took the clock to pieces, cleaned it, and put it
together again. Rumours of this new &ldquo;handiness&rdquo;
spread, and colliers from far and near sent
their watches and clocks to him to doctor. It
was almost as if nothing came amiss to these
wonderful hands or, indeed, to that wonderful
brain.</p>

<p>A wheezy engine pump, a clock out of gear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
a pair of worn-out shoes&mdash;he had a remedy for
all. Painstaking, conscientious, thorough&mdash;the
work of the boy shadowed forth the success of
the man.</p>

<p>If I had space I could tell you how, after he
ceased to be a boy, he became a splendid man.
That divine capacity&mdash;the creative faculty for
making something out of nothing&mdash;that had
been struggling long within him came to the
surface, and he burst on the world as an Inventor.</p>

<p>The boon he gave to men&mdash;the thing with
which his name will ever be linked in history&mdash;is
the Locomotive Steam Engine.</p>

<p>What battles he fought for it when the
country rose in arms and said they would
rather hold by the old post-horses and coaches
that had been good enough for their fathers!
They were hard to convince. They declared if
railways and trains came the country would be
ruined. The engines would vomit forth smoke.
No bird could live in the poisoned air. Game
all over the country would be spoiled. The
sparks that came from the engine would set fire
to the houses near which they passed. Hens
would stop laying! Cattle would cease to graze!
The man who said he would send engines flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
through the air at the rate of twenty miles an
hour was a fool and a maniac!</p>

<p>Then Stephenson showed the same patience&mdash;for
the world was long of being convinced&mdash;as
he had done on those long night-shifts, sitting
lonely by the engine fire and working out his
sums, or as years later, when prospects were very
dark and money scarce, he wept bitter tears,
&ldquo;for he knew not where his lot in life would be
cast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But though only a self-taught mechanic,
Stephenson stuck to his guns in the face of
the most skilled engineers in the land. For
two long months the thing hung in the balance.
It came before the great House of Commons.
George himself was put into the witness-box.
Single-handed, undaunted, he faced a world that
was all against him. And then he had to bear
the great trial of his life. The Bill was thrown
out of Parliament. But still he did not despair.
He looked into the future, and he saw himself
conqueror. The Bill was again brought forward
and eventually passed. I could tell you then of
his long course of triumphs. How his engine,
&ldquo;The Rocket,&rdquo; won a 500 prize. How really
the first seed of the Railway System of the world
was sown then. How then he got leave to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
make a railway between Stockton and Darlington,
and in time one between Manchester and
Liverpool. How when, in 1830, the line was
finished, people flocked in hundreds and thousands
to see &ldquo;a steam coach running upon a
railway at three times the speed of a mail-coach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The people were carried away with excitement!
The great steam-horse that we look at
half a dozen times a day with indifference was
thought to be the world&rsquo;s greatest wonder.
And George Stephenson was the hero of the
hour. As the train neared Manchester, the
people in their excitement broke all bounds,
and even the military could not keep order, as
they swarmed on the carriage like bees, and
hung on to the handles, many of them being
tumbled off, while shoutings and cheers went up
from a thousand throats.</p>

<p>And now that he was successful, now that
people praised where they had blamed, and
pandered where they had scoffed, the man remained
the same&mdash;modest, single-minded, just
what he had been as the boy earning his shilling
a day by driving the old &ldquo;gin&rdquo; horse at the
pit&rsquo;s mouth.</p>

<p>And now from the humble labourer&rsquo;s cottage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
he had climbed to the highest heights of fame.
He was the first mechanical genius in the eyes
of the world. The greatest in the land rejoiced
to honour him. From the depths of poverty he
had risen to wealth. Honours flowed in upon
him. But the &ldquo;boy is father to the man,&rdquo; and
it was peculiarly true of George Stephenson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never want,&rdquo; he had said long years
before, when he was earning 100 a year, and
was able to keep a horse, &ldquo;I never want to be
higher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was much the same as in those old days.
There was no dazzling him with worldly display
or worldly honours. He cared little for
social distinctions. His instincts all along had
been &ldquo;to dwell among his own people.&rdquo; It
gave him the keenest pleasure to have a day at
Newcastle among the scenes of his boyhood,
looking up the simple friends of his youth.
And his tastes, too, remained in many ways
just the old simple ones. When he was an old
man, and nearing the end of his pilgrimage,
when he was surrounded by every luxury of
table and otherwise, he would call for a
&ldquo;crowdie,&rdquo; and with the basin of boiling water
between his knees, would stir in the oatmeal
with his own hands, watching it with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
satisfaction, and then sup the whole with sweet
milk, pronouncing it &ldquo;capital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His last days were very peaceful. He removed
from the swirling current of business life into a
side eddy, when he was about sixty, to a place
called Tapton, where he lived a quiet life, meditating
among his beasts and birds and flowers,
reading in each something of the beauty of the
mind of a Greater Inventor than he. He took
no part in business life, leaving it to his son,
though now and then he would hear from afar
echoes from the old world as the old war-horse
scents the smoke of battle.</p>

<p>There was no long illness to mar the end of
his splendid energetic life. Those who had
known him in the full tide and flush of health
had not the pain of noting either physical or
mental decay. He was at a meeting in connection
with engineering in July. Some weeks
later he took a severe fever, and after ten day&rsquo;s
illness, without much suffering, the end came.
On the 12th August, in his sixty-seventh year,
George Stephenson, the great engineer, passed
away.</p>

<p>The whole civilised world bewailed his going.
He had lived long enough for it to realise and
appreciate the mark he had made on the age.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
But most of all did the colliers mourn him&mdash;the
men to whom he had been as a kindly father, a
leader, a hero. They laid him in the quiet little
churchyard at Chesterfield, and they raised
monuments to him all over the country, as a
grateful people will do,&mdash;erected statues and
memorial schools, and painted portraits. But
a man like George Stephenson needs no memorial
of stone. He has left an undying work to
speak for him, and a character that has moved
men to admiration everywhere for its simplicity,
combined with its greatness, its manliness, that
made it possible for him, the poor collier&rsquo;s son,
to meet on equal ground&mdash;himself also being a
man&mdash;men of the highest rank in the land.</p>

<p>We cannot, any of us, imitate his genius or
his power of invention, or his splendid physical
strength, but it is within the scope of all of us,
however young or insignificant, to copy his
conscientious, unwearied hard work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, ye lads,&rdquo; he used to say to young men
when he was himself an old one, in his broad,
honest Doric, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s none o&rsquo; ye know what
<em>wark</em> is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He has left us a splendid example of patience,
content, courage, attention to detail. But most
precious of all, of a heart that beat as kindly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
old age as in youth, that made him dearly loved
by his workmen, and that never turned away
from hearing and helping those in trouble.</p>

<p>Riches and success and prosperity, crowding
upon him in later years, had no power to spoil
the simple beauty of his character, for the Wylam
collier&rsquo;s son, besides being the world&rsquo;s honoured
inventor, was also &ldquo;one of Nature&rsquo;s gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THOMAS ALVA EDISON.</h2>
<hr class="l6" />

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">To</span> see as a boy the greatest inventor of the
age, we shall have to cross the Atlantic and
take a journey to the United States of America.
England has done wonders in the way of discovery
and invention, but it is to New England,
as we call it, because she is a daughter of the
old Mother Country, that we must go for a
brightness and a sharpness of wit that sometimes
make us think of the flash of polished
steel.</p>

<p>We all know the name of Edison. It is not
a name of history, for he is living to-day, a man
still in his prime, still sending out from that
wonderful brain of his things that astonish men,
and have won for him the name of the &ldquo;wonder-worker
of the modern world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have before me as I write the picture of a
square, brick house, with outside shutters hooked
back, a white paling half encircling it, and a couple
of bare, leafless trees before it. The house is
plain and poor, and has a strangely unfamiliar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
look to our English eyes, but it is of the deepest
interest to us as the birthplace of Thomas Edison.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_122.jpg" width="403" height="641" alt="EDISON IN HIS LABORATORY." title="" />
<br /><span class="caption">EDISON IN HIS LABORATORY.</span>
</div>

<p>The boy first saw the light in 1847, and
though he came into the world with but a poor
provision waiting him, he found himself welcomed
with a very wealth of love and tenderness.
Mrs. Edison had Scotch blood in her
veins, and she was a mother in a thousand. It
is a common thing in history to find that a
son draws his greatness, many of his best
qualities, from his mother, and this son took
many of his from Mrs. Edison. She was his
constant companion, his loving nurse, his gentle
teacher during those early years of life that
leave so deep an impress on the &ldquo;afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child was seven years old when the
Edison family moved to a place called Port
Huron, and there he began to spend every spare
moment in reading. So earnest was he that
he set himself to read through the Detroit Free
Library, and had devoured a close row of volumes
before his attempt was discovered.</p>

<p>Strange and solemn sound some of the titles
of the books he read when he was twelve years
old&mdash;a time when most boys are lightly dipping
into newspapers and magazines and books of
adventure. Burton&rsquo;s <cite>Anatomy of Melancholy</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Hume&rsquo;s <cite>History of England</cite>, Gibbon&rsquo;s <cite>Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire</cite>.</p>

<p>In 1862, when he was barely fifteen years
old, he came out more fully from the shelter
of home and mixed with the busy world, making
a place in it for himself by his own young wits.
He was a newspaper boy, and sold his papers
like other boys, not stopping still in one place,
but going on the train to different stations
along the line, and selling as he went.</p>

<p>About this time there was a great fever and
ferment in America. The North were fighting
with the South, and people panted for news
of each battle as it took place. Papers with
reports were devoured as soon as printed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; thought Edison, &ldquo;is my chance,&rdquo;
and there began to work in the brain of the
boy a big scheme. As the first step to carrying
it out, he betook himself to the station telegraph
clerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will let me wire the war
news on a few stations ahead, and have it written
up on the blackboard, I will promise you some
papers, and now and then a magazine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He repeated his request to the different clerks
along the line. His eager face and twinkling
eyes and earnest words won all hearts, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
request was granted. He next went to the
editor of a well-known paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me a thousand copies,&rdquo; he begged,
&ldquo;and I will pay out of the proceeds of my
venture.&rdquo; Here, again, he succeeded. And now
it remained but to get the engine-driver to
promise him a few minutes at the different
stations, and he started on his venture.</p>

<p>At the first stopping-place he had been wont
to sell some half-dozen papers. That day, as
he looked out, the platform was strangely
crowded, and it suddenly dawned on him, from
the eager faces of the people and their excited
gestures, that it was <em>papers</em> they wanted! He
dashed on to the platform, and in a few minutes
had sold forty at five cents each, or about a
penny of our money. It was much the same
at the next station. The people had read the
headings on the station blackboard, and they
crowded on to the platform, an excited, hustling
mob, for papers! It dawned on the boy,
here was a chance to raise his prices, so he
doubled them, and sold 150 where he had used
to sell a dozen! It was the same all along the
line. At the last station&mdash;Port Huron&mdash;his
home, the people were most excited of all. The
town was a mile from the station. Edison started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
off with his papers, but was met half-way by
an eager, hurrying crowd. They all wanted
news. He stopped, drawing up in front of a
church where a prayer-meeting was being held.
Presently the people poured out and surrounded
the boy, willingly paying him five times the
usual price of his paper. He began &ldquo;to take
in,&rdquo; as he expressed it, in his own terse, telling
words, &ldquo;a young fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this the busy boyish brain began to
look eagerly ahead, to face life seriously. He
did not start off on a fresh tack. He took hold
of what was nearest to his hand, and he bent
his mind on improving that. He had found
people were in a hurry for news. The quicker
they got it the better they were pleased.
Nothing could surely be quicker than that they
should get it damp from the press! So it
flashed into his brain&mdash;why not print a paper
on the train?</p>

<p>The question was no sooner asked than
answered.</p>

<p>He looked about till he lighted on an old car,
and he rigged it up as a printing-office with old
types and stereos he begged from a newspaper
office. In this novel press-room he threw off
sheet after sheet of what he called <cite>The Grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Trunk Herald</cite>, the first and last paper ever
printed on a train. The boy of fifteen was
editor, compositor, and newsvendor in one. The
paper &ldquo;caught on,&rdquo; and the circulation went up
to 400.</p>

<p>But, alas! misfortune was soon to overwhelm
the young adventurer. One unlucky day the
printing-office&mdash;the old car, which grew daily
more decrepit and unequal to the jolting of the
journey&mdash;by a more violent lurch than usual
threw over a bottle of phosphorus. The cork
flew out, and in a few seconds the car was in
flames. They were easily enough got under,
but Edison&rsquo;s venture had received its deathblow.
The furious car-conductor would henceforth
have none of him. He boxed his ears,
and pitched him on to the platform along with
his precious belongings&mdash;the whole paraphernalia
of his craft.</p>

<p>It is a sorry picture that presents itself to our
mind&rsquo;s eye. The boy standing half stunned, the
rubbish and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dbris</i> of his belongings strewn at
his feet, and the cherished old jolting car, the
scene of his labours, gradually fading into distance!
It seemed as if his bright dreams were
all extinguished, his golden hopes doomed to
come to nothing. As he stood there he faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
it all&mdash;a mere boy low down in the world,
badly fed, poorly clothed, almost penniless, but
we do not hear that he either flinched or complained,
or that a boyish sob rose in his throat.
He was made of the stuff of the Stoic. It is
our hearts that are sore and anguished, not
chiefly for the hopes and dreams disappointed,
but because of a terrible calamity that befell him
then, when he was perhaps hardly conscious of
it; but that grew darker and weightier as the
years rolled on.</p>

<p>When the irritated conductor had boxed the
boy&rsquo;s ears, so brutal had been his onslaught that
the delicate nerves were injured for life, and
now with the flight of years has come deafness
to wrap the great inventor in a partial mantle
of silence. It is perhaps we who feel most the
infinite pathos of the thing, while the man himself
bears his affliction with the same noble
patience with which he accepted disappointment
long years ago as a boy.</p>

<p>At that time he straightway turned his eyes
bravely homewards. He picked up his precious
belongings, and carried them to a cellar in his
father&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>It was about this time that his mind began
to bend towards that which has ever held for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
him a keen interest through life&mdash;the Telegraph.
A waking ambition in him desired strongly to
perfect himself in it. He was poor and friendless,
and yet firmly, doggedly resolved to get
on somehow. So out of his scant earnings&mdash;still
as newsboy&mdash;he bought a book on Telegraphy,
and this he pored over night and day.</p>

<p>And now at this early age I think the great
inventor must have touched that mine that was
afterwards to yield him so wondrously of its
wealth.</p>

<p>The boyish mind was putting out feelers,
gropingly at first, in the direction of creation,
that divine faculty that is granted to so few of us.
We can recognise the seed in its first tiny sproutings.
He and a boy friend resolved to make
a telegraph. They made a line of wire between
their houses, insulated with bottles, and crossed
under a busy thoroughfare by means of an old
cable found in the bed of the Detroit River.
The first magnets were wound with wire and
swathed in ancient rags, and a piece of spring
brass formed the key. Edison pressed two large
and formidable-looking cats into his service, tied
a wire to their legs, and applied friction to their
backs. But the experiment ended in failure.
The cats, frightened and furious, resented the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
liberty, and parted company with, the wire, dashing
off in different directions.</p>

<p>But failure never discouraged Edison, nor
stayed the working of his brain. He was a true
philosopher, and he was, like an elastic ball,
possessed of enormous rebound.</p>

<p>Handed down to us there is a story of the
boy which, while it may not throw much light
on his brain, throws some on his heart and on
his ready courage. He was still a newspaper
boy on the trains, and while at most stations
a few minutes was the limit of waiting, at a
certain station where shunting took place the
minutes ran to half an hour. The boy was
wont to spend this half-hour with the stationmaster&rsquo;s
child, of whom he was fond, or to loiter
about his garden. On this particular day the
engine-driver had unlinked the cars in a siding,
and one was being sent with a good deal of
impetus to join another portion. It came on
steadily, no one on it to control it, and right in
its path was the unconscious baby smiling in
the morning sunshine. Not a moment was to
be lost. Edison threw down his papers and his
hat on the platform and dashed to the rescue.
And not a second too soon. As he threw himself
and the child free of the line the car passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and struck his heel. The two fell with such
violence on the gravel beyond that the stone
particles were driven into their flesh, but they
were safe!</p>

<p>The grateful father was at a loss how he
could show his gratitude to the rescuer of his
child. He had little money and no reward to
give. At last a plan occurred to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will teach you telegraphing,&rdquo; he said to
the boy, &ldquo;and prepare you for the position of
night operator at not less than twenty-five
dollars a month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edison was delighted. The bargain was struck.
The wage seemed, no doubt, a small fortune to
the boy&mdash;rather more than five of our English
pounds.</p>

<p>And now he had got his &ldquo;toe on the tape,&rdquo; his
foot on the ladder, if it were only on the lowest
round. In three months he could teach his
master, and the promised situation was got for
him. From that he passed to other situations,
and gradually he began to make his mark.</p>

<p>He had a mind wonderfully quick to see a
difficult situation and to deal with it.</p>

<p>There is a story told of how one winter a
severe frost had coated the great river between
Port Huron and Sarnia, how the cable was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
broken, and people could neither get news nor
send it to the opposite bank of the river. The
spot was crowded with people, baffled and vexed.
Edison came along with a brain rarely at fault
and faced the thing. Suddenly, to the onlookers&rsquo;
astonishment, he mounted a locomotive and sent
a piercing whistle across the water, imitating by
the toots of the engine the dots and dashes of
the telegraph system.</p>

<p>In this way he shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Holloa, Sarnia! Sarnia, do you get what I
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first there was silence on the part of the
telegraph man across the water. The people on
the bank were breathless with excitement. At
last the reply came clear&mdash;thrilling. The man
on the other side had understood, and the two
cities could &ldquo;talk&rdquo; again to each other.</p>

<p>After this, people began to hear of Edison&rsquo;s
fame. But the mania for experiments had seized
him. The cut-and-dried monotonous routine of
work seemed flat and stale to him by comparison.
It was as if an enchanted region of fairyland had
been opened to the boy. To be allowed to revel
in it he denied himself food and necessary sleep.
When he was seventeen years old he invented
a telegraph instrument that would transfer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
writing from one line to another without the
help of the operator.</p>

<p>There were no want of openings now for him
to choose from, but sometimes doors after they
had been opened were rudely shut again through
envy and evil feeling. In the great world of
invention and discovery there are perhaps more
&ldquo;ups and downs&rdquo; than in any other. Some of
Edison&rsquo;s fellow-workers were kind and generous&mdash;others
were jealous and detracting. One
manager did him an ill turn. He was unequal
to completing a discovery he had begun. On
the thing being shown him, Edison immediately
&ldquo;saw a light&rdquo; and brought it to completion, but
jealousy crept into the man&rsquo;s small mind and he
dismissed the boy on a false charge.</p>

<p>So at seventeen he was thrown again on the
world. Money was still scarce. Books and instruments
and calls from home swallowed up the
most of it. The boy was chafing under ill-treatment
and a sense of injustice. The want of
sleep, perhaps of proper food, was telling on him,
but he looked forward with a clear, undaunted
eye. He wanted to reach a certain town where
he believed work awaited him. It meant a
walk of a hundred miles. He was weak, disheartened,
ill-prepared for it, but he did it. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
arrived footsore and weary, with torn shoes and
tattered clothes, and his worldly possessions tied
in a handkerchief on his back.</p>

<p>In this shabby plight he presented himself at
the telegraph office. He was eyed coldly enough
at first, but by-and-by when tests were given he
stood the tests. There was that in the eager eyes
and underneath the shabby clothes that could not
but make itself felt as a power. He began work.
At first his fellow-clerks laughed at him. In
time they were won over, and later he stood out
as a workman of the first order.</p>

<p>He began to collect about him materials for
printing&mdash;machinery without which he never
felt quite happy. He did a clever thing one day
in the office that brought him into notice. He
took a press report at one sitting&mdash;a sitting that
lasted from 3.30 p.m. till 4.30 a.m.! After that he
carefully divided it into paragraphs so that each
printer would have exactly three lines to print,
and so that a column could be set up in two or
three minutes!</p>

<p>It may be that about this time money was
rather more plentiful, for Edison began to go to
second-hand bookshops and so to gratify his deep-seated
thirst for knowledge.</p>

<p>His kindness of heart was well known, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
there were many about only too ready to take
advantage of it. There were telegraphists who
roamed the country in time of war&mdash;&ldquo;tramp
operators&rdquo; they were called, who took short engagements
and generally ended their time with
a &ldquo;spree.&rdquo; These found out Edison&mdash;a man
who did not drink himself and a man who might
be persuaded to lend them money&mdash;and these
were his worst enemies.</p>

<p>One day he had bought at an auction fifty
volumes of the <cite>North American Review</cite>. Half
a dozen men were sponging off him in his rooms
when he brought home the books and ranged
them unsuspiciously round his walls. Directly
he had gone out his guests helped themselves to
his purchase, landed them at the nearest pawnbroker&rsquo;s,
and drank the money they brought.</p>

<p>But his love for experiments sometimes
brought him into scrapes and disaster, as when
he moved a bottle of sulphuric acid one day,
strictly against rules, and the bottle spilt, the
contents eating through the floor to the manager&rsquo;s
room below and there eating up <em>his</em> floor and
carpet, the unlucky accident bringing Edison his
dismissal.</p>

<p>And now, at the age of twenty-one, after many
different situations and different experiences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Edison turned his steps to Boston. His openhandedness
had left him short of money. As
was often the case with him, he was sailing very
close to the wind. His dress was poor and shabby,
and four days&rsquo; and nights&rsquo; travelling had not improved
his appearance. When he presented
himself at the office where he was to be taken
on, the other clerks ridiculed him as &ldquo;a jay from
the woolly west.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They made up their minds to play a practical
joke on him. They took the New York telegraph
man into their confidence. It was arranged he
should send a despatch which Edison was to
receive. By this time Edison had so perfected
himself in receiving messages that he could write
from forty-six to fifty-four words a minute&mdash;quicker
than any operator in the United States.</p>

<p>Not knowing his man, the sender began slowly&mdash;then
quickened his pace. So did Edison.
Quicker still he worked. Edison was in no way
discomfited. Soon the New York man had
reached his highest speed, to which Edison responded
with ease, cool, collected, and stopping
now and then to sharpen a pencil between.</p>

<p>By this time he had discovered that the
others were trying to get &ldquo;a rise&rdquo; out of him,
but he went on steadily with his work. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
he stopped and spoke quietly through to the
New York man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, young man,&rdquo; he said, in his dry humorous
way, &ldquo;change off and send with your other foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the New York man had reached the end of
his tether and had to get someone else to finish,
and so Edison won his laurels, and &ldquo;the jay from
the woolly west&rdquo; was regarded ever after with
enormous respect.</p>

<p>After that his place was in the front rank.
Now he had reached the threshold of manhood,
and a long, dazzling vista of achievement and
success stretched before him had he known it.
About this time a great, strong conviction of his
responsibilities and of the opportunities life held
out to him swept over him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adams,&rdquo; he said to a friend, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got so
much to do, and life is so short, that I&rsquo;m going
to hustle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And if we try to look at what he has crowded
into a life not long, we must allow he has indeed
&ldquo;hustled&rdquo; to some purpose. As we briefly
glance at the bent of his manhood, his doings
fairly dazzle us. He read enormously all sorts
of works on telegraphy and electricity, and he
produced from his brain that which makes him
the greatest inventor of the age. If we tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
enumerate his inventions the names alone would
fill pages. We can do little more than name
a few. Among the first of these was how to
send four messages at the same time over one
telegraph wire.</p>

<p>But even after he had embarked on the
glorious sea of discovery, what &ldquo;ups and downs&rdquo;&mdash;what
sea-saws of fortune were in store for
him! Hunger at times, torn clothes, and battered
shoes. But from depths and half-drowning up
again he always came to the surface. He rose
grandly, relying on his own indomitable will.
About this time good fortune befell him. For
inventing some telegraphic appliances he got
50,000 dollars, or rather more than 10,000.
He could hardly believe his good luck, and it was
with this he immediately rigged up for himself
a workshop.</p>

<p>And now he was rapidly rising, and the field
before him was gradually opening up wider and
wider. He started a laboratory at a place called
Newark, and from this time onwards his inventions
seemed to flow from his brain in a well-nigh
continuous stream.</p>

<p>His workmen were devoted to his service.
His genial good-humour and kindliness, the
absence of all harshness in his manner, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
love of fun could not but endear him to them.
They caught the infection, too, of his earnestness.
When he had an idea in his brain he
worked at it, as it were, red-hot, almost without
rest or cessation, and they were rarely reluctant
to help him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you fellows!&rdquo; he would say, shutting
himself and his workmen up in a room on the
top flat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve locked the door, and you&rsquo;ll have
to stay here until this job is completed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During sixty hours, perhaps, he would take
no sleep and little food, while his brain would
work at highest pressure until the thing was
wrought. Then he would relax, and sleep for as
long as thirty-six hours at a stretch.</p>

<p>And now his fame had spread far and wide.
The people at Menlo Park, to which he removed&mdash;some
twenty-four miles from New York&mdash;began
to look upon him as a wizard&mdash;a man
possessing magical powers. It seemed to them
there was nothing he could not do. Exaggerated
tales of his wonderful powers spread over the
country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If people track me here,&rdquo; he said (he had
been besieged at Newark), &ldquo;I shall simply have
to take to the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Child after child was the offspring of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
inventor&rsquo;s brain. At one time, within the space
of a few years, as many as forty-five were born.</p>

<p>There was the Microphone, which is much like
the Telephone, except that in the Microphone the
sound is magnified. There was the Megaphone,
which brings far-away sounds near, so that cattle
crunching grass six miles off could be heard
distinctly at Menlo Park! There was the Kinetoscope
we all know, which by swiftly passing
pictures&mdash;as many as forty-six a second&mdash;seems
to give us a single person in motion, somewhat
on the lines of that toy of our childhood, &ldquo;The
Wheel of Life.&rdquo; And there was the grand king
of inventions&mdash;the Phonograph&mdash;that overtops
all the rest.</p>

<p>We know it, all of us, by this time. We have
listened to it, with the tubes at our ears, while
the voice of someone speaking at a distance is
distinctly borne to us, or the strains of a song
sung by some great singer.</p>

<p>In 1888 Edison sent his first phonogram by
steamer to England. His friend here had only
to take out the wax cylinder, put it into his
machine, and set it in motion, and lo! it seemed
to him as if Edison himself were in the room
talking to him!</p>

<p>Great men all over the world recorded their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
astonishment and their praises of the wonderful
invention. The Queen sent him a message of
congratulation. People flocked to every exhibition
to see it&mdash;to the French one from countries
all over Europe. They saw it and straightway
went into raptures. Edison himself, looking into
the future, seemed to see volumes it might yet
be brought to do. It might be used to write
letters merely from dictation. It might be used
to make clocks speak&mdash;to tell when it was time
to come to meals. It might be used for toys.
A tiny phonograph might be placed inside a
doll, and it would straightway &ldquo;talk&rdquo;; or in
a toy animal, and it would grunt and growl!</p>

<p>What a strange thing that in this world of
passing-away and change we should be able to
preserve from destruction such treasures sheltered
in a wax cylinder&mdash;some great man&rsquo;s words
of wisdom, or the silver tones of a sweet
musician!</p>

<p>The more Edison&rsquo;s brain accomplished the
more did it seem able to do. As a man he
showed himself untiring as when a boy. He
went on discovering. He invented a way of
telegraphing from a moving train. He invented
an Electric Railroad, that drew delighted thousands
at the Chicago Exhibition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1879 his attention turned to lighting, and
he bent all his energies on inventing an Incandescent
lamp for electric light. He spent days
working at a sort of white heat. He began on
the 16th October, but mishaps and accidents
seemed to threaten his invention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us,&rdquo; he cried to his partner in a ferment
of excitement&mdash;&ldquo;let us make a lamp before we
sleep, or die in the attempt.&rdquo; On the morning
of the 21st it was done!</p>

<p>It astonished the world. It opened up possibilities
for miners and divers, and for men
everywhere.</p>

<p>On the occasion of its exhibition people flocked
from all parts of the United States. Special
trains were run. The same furore over the
marvel reigned at the Paris Exposition, and at
every other exhibition. And through it all&mdash;a
fame, a popularity enough to turn the head
of most mortals&mdash;the man remained the same&mdash;modest,
simple, unpretentious.</p>

<p>From Menlo Park he went to Orange. His
laboratory there was fitted up with everything
conceivable that an inventor red-hot and eager
might want at a moment&rsquo;s notice. And yet
often the workrooms presented the strangest
appearance of disorder. Workmen sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
stretched on benches or floor after a heavy
strain, the great master himself thrown down&mdash;a
stick under his head, a coat wound round it
for a pillow, and so snatching a short interval
of sleep! He will not be interrupted by visitors.
In this great world of his own he seems at times
to live a sort of separate existence.</p>

<p>We are amazed, dazzled, astonished by the
tremendous results one man in his lifetime has
achieved. He has not been content to take
some thing and modify and improve it and set
it to a new purpose as men whom we call
inventors have done in all ages. But he seems
to have called upon the very forces of nature
to do his bidding. It is almost as if he had
harnessed the winds, the air, sound, electricity,
for his purposes.</p>

<p>A man after a single discovery not seldom
rests on his laurels for life. This man is still in
his prime, and we cannot tell yet what product
of his brain will still astonish us, and we cannot
touch here on a tithe of what he has done. He
lives sometimes in his northern home, in New
Jersey, sometimes at Orange.</p>

<p>As a man he shows the same genial, kindly
sympathy which, as a boy, never failed to win
the hearts of his fellow-clerks, the same modesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
that disarmed their jealousy. These things chain
his workmen to him to-day with links of love.
Now that men praise and laud him all over the
world he shows the same good-natured indifference
to name and fame he has shown all through.
And he has lost nothing of the tireless energy
that used to support him through hard work
and long night-sittings as a boy&mdash;this man who,
as someone has it, &ldquo;has kept the path to the
patent office red-hot with his footsteps&mdash;this
wonder-worker of the modern world.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>JAMES WATT.</h2>
<hr class="l6" />

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> is perhaps no inventor&rsquo;s name with
which the British boy is more familiar than
with that of James Watt. In every college of
mechanics or engineers we are met in bust or
print by the kindly, shrewd, benevolent face of
the great inventor of the Condensing Steam
Engine.</p>

<p>It is difficult for us to picture what the world
must have been before James Watt came into
it&mdash;before, as it were, steam took its place and
while yet men and horses and wind and water
struggled feebly to do what steam now does
with such apparent ease.</p>

<p>On the west coast of Scotland stands what
is to-day the busy, thriving, seaport town of
Greenock&mdash;the birthplace of James Watt. But
in 1736, more than 150 years ago, it was little
more than a picturesque fishing-village, looking
out on a peaceful, smiling bay, where a few
modest fishing-craft were to be seen, and
beyond to the hills of Argyllshire, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
smoke and funnels blotted the fairness of the
landscape.</p>

<p>In an unpretentious little house in a Greenock
by-street James Watt first saw the light. His
father was by trade a carpenter, an undertaker,
a general &ldquo;merchant,&rdquo; for there was little competition
in those simple days, and men often
&ldquo;professed&rdquo; more than one trade. In the course
of a few years little James was left the sole
surviving child of five, and perhaps on that
account was specially precious to his parents.
Neither as the years went on did he grow into
a sturdy, lusty country boy, but rather struggled
up slowly, anxiously overlooked by a mother&rsquo;s
care, a prey to ill-health and headache, even in
his baby years. So that most of his early
education fell to his parents, his mother opening
up to him the beginnings of reading, his father
those of writing and arithmetic.</p>

<p>School, to which he went by-and-by, proved
a failure. Shy and shrinking, he cared little for
the play of other children. He was slow at
games, perhaps dull in class, and the boys and
girls laughed at him. Ill-health, too, made it
hard for him to get on. He liked best to be at
home. For amusement he would draw in chalk
on the kitchen floor, and for playthings he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
would choose his father&rsquo;s instruments. One day
a neighbour remarked on the child&rsquo;s drawing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He should be at school,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and not
trifling away his time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look first,&rdquo; said the father, pointing to the
floor, &ldquo;before you blame him. He is solving a
problem in geometry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child was then six years old!</p>

<p>We are familiar with the story handed down
to us through the centuries of how the dreamy-eyed
boy was engaged in watching the steam
hiss from the kettle-spout, the while holding a
teaspoon below to count and catch the drops of
water. Tradition likes to see in this the tiny
seedlings of that mighty tree&mdash;the Condensing
Steam Engine, but we fear that common sense
in the shape of his robust-minded aunt was
nearer the mark when she exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;James Watt, I never saw such an idle boy
as you are. For the last hour you have not
spoken one word, but taken off the lid of that
kettle and put it on again, holding now a cup
and now a silver spoon over the steam, watching
how it rises from the spout, catching and counting
the drops it falls into.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For change of air the boy was sometimes
sent to Glasgow, the great commercial capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
being then no larger than a country market-town.
Mightily astonished were his relatives,
and, according to their own account, not a
little scared, when of an evening his tongue
was loosed, and he would launch into tales,
wonderful things that held them entranced for
hours, and sent them wakeful to bed. Was
this time prophetic of those later years when
he would hold men and women fascinated by
the charm of his conversation?</p>

<p>And now young James was sent to the
Greenock Grammar School, but he made no
great mark there, except in mathematics, in
which he easily headed the class. But Latin
and Greek are not a boy&rsquo;s only education. At
home he was learning other things, from his
parents&rsquo; talk, from the pages of books. And
then there were the long golden hours when he
put on a leather apron like his father, and
installed himself in his father&rsquo;s workshop with
a small forge and a small bench all his own, and
with his boyish fingers handled the tools so
deftly and so cleverly that the workmen watching
him exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little Jamie has gotten a fortune at his
fingers&rsquo; ends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But while he worked his mind was not idle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
He read eagerly and precociously, as a delicate
child sometimes does, devouring all such books
as he could lay hands on. Solid enough reading
they will seem to boys to-day.</p>

<p><cite>The Cloud of Witnesses</cite>, Henry the Rymer&rsquo;s
<cite>Life of Wallace</cite>, Boston, Bunyan.</p>

<p>Added to this was his parents&rsquo; talk, that fell
on his young ears and stamped itself on his
young mind, and the picturesque surroundings
of his home, for he loved nature&rsquo;s beauties&mdash;the
hills, the stars, the trees. The mountains and
the plains about his home were made romantic
by memories and associations of Covenanting
times, told him by his father, and his boyish
rambles were made beautiful by wild flowers,
and again there were long delightful days of
fishing to add to these.</p>

<p>But in the midst of all this struggling in the
boy&rsquo;s mind was that strong leaning to mechanical
invention longing for an outlet. It peeped
out here and there&mdash;for instance, in being
unable to see an instrument without wishing
to discover all its uses. And so well did he
show himself able even then to fashion delicate
things like compasses and quadrants&mdash;an instrument
in shape like the fourth of a circle&mdash;that
his father, after much thought, made up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
mind that James should learn the trade of a
mathematical instrument maker.</p>

<p>So in 1754 James came out from the shelter
of home and launched himself on the great
world, rather more of an ordeal to the shy,
timid boy than it would have been to one more
robust and enterprising. This was practically
the last of Greenock. The peaceful fishing-village
was never again to be his home. Naturally
he turned his steps to Glasgow. We can
picture the great event in the quiet household.
The boy getting ready, his modest baggage,
his clothes (his mother&rsquo;s tender care), a
leather apron, some carpenter&rsquo;s tools, and a
quadrant.</p>

<p>But he was destined to go yet farther afield.
No mathematical instrument-maker was to be
found in Glasgow. A professor to whom James
was introduced advised him to go to London.
&ldquo;To London&rdquo; is an easy enough journey to-day&mdash;then
it was a mighty undertaking. No
trains&mdash;no steamers. One could only go by
slow coach or on horseback. James chose the
latter. His trunk was sent by sea from Leith,
and he along with a friend set off on his long
journey. He left on the 7th day of June, and
travelling by Coldstream and Newcastle, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
arrived in the great metropolis after a ride of
twelve days!</p>

<p>Most likely, although there might have been
fear in the boyish heart, it also beat high with
hope. Again and again has London made fair
promises to boys such as he. But disappointment
was to meet him on the very threshold.
He found that apprentices who intended to
serve a term of seven years were only accepted.
This was very far from James&rsquo;s thoughts. What
he wanted was to learn the trade, start off
home again, and set up in Glasgow for himself
as soon as possible. After many failures, however,
he at last found a man willing to take
him on for a year on his promise to pay twenty
guineas with the results of his work during
that time.</p>

<p>And now began a time of stern work and self-denial.
He took poor lodgings. He scrimped
himself in everything but the bare necessaries of
life. He spent on himself exactly eight shillings
a week. He could not, he wrote, do with less.
He scraped and pinched, remembering how ill
his father could afford his keep.</p>

<p>When he could get extra work he took it
home at nights to his poor rooms and sat up late
over it, often ill and weary. In a month he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
could make a quadrant better than any of the
other apprentices. And so he struggled on
against loneliness and headache and depression.
It was rarely safe to venture out at night at that
time in London, for sailor press-gangs were
abroad. No able-bodied man was spared. In
one night they took as many as 1,000 men.
Sitting as he did close to the shop door when at
work, he was often exposed to cold, and caught
rheumatic pains which did not leave him for
many a day. After a year of this he went
home to Greenock, in his possession some tools
and instruments, and in his hands and brain a
mighty store of skill and knowledge.</p>

<p>Revived by his native air he set out again to
seek his fortune&mdash;again to Glasgow. Again to
be met with disappointment! He had not
learned his trade in Glasgow, and therefore
Glasgow would have none of him. Not so much
as a workshop would it give him. It seemed
almost as if there were no place open for the
boy.</p>

<p>But his friend the professor came to the
front again. If Watt could find no place in the
city, then the University should shelter him.
And so they gave him a workshop twenty feet
square in the old College grounds, and a room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
in which to sell his instruments, and he was at
last fairly launched.</p>

<p>But business progressed but slowly. He
lived, to be sure, in an atmosphere that must
have delighted him. The professors and the
students found him out. They came and came
again. He seemed always to have something
original to say. He was a man who read much
and thought much&mdash;humble as a child about his
own attainments&mdash;eager with the generosity of
the great man to give others their due&mdash;yes,
even more than their due. They found out that
he knew all about engineering, and not a little
about natural history, art, languages&mdash;and then
the trick of observation was so strong with him
that nothing escaped him. In time it came to
be the general opinion that the young instrument-maker
was one of the ablest men about the
University. But gratifying as was the making
of these friends, they did not bring Watt in any
money. Somehow his instruments did not sell
well. He was too far from the town. Indeed,
his business was so poor he sometimes thought
of giving it up. It may have been there was a
want of practical &ldquo;push&rdquo; in him, a quality he
never gained all through his life. Somewhat
discouraged he took to making fiddles and flutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and guitars and even organs,&mdash;but he was yet
very far from making that fortune he had come
out to seek.</p>

<p>There are crises, turning-points in the lives
of most people. They are seldom noisy. Sometimes,
indeed, they come so quietly as to be
hardly noticed. And now Watt was gradually
nearing his.</p>

<p>About this time his thoughts began to turn to
steam. It may be that had he been busy and
successful as an organ-maker, his great invention
might never have seen the light.</p>

<p>People had, of course, known for long that
there was a power in water exposed to heat.
Now in 1759, when Watt was twenty-three, his
attention was drawn to the Steam Engine. He
pondered it. After he had pondered it he set to
work. His first model was a failure. But the
idea had silently and firmly lodged in his brain.
He went on with his everyday business, but ever
in his leisure back sprang his mind to that
subject that was to be his all-absorbing life-work.
He read eagerly what other men had
done. He got a model of another man&rsquo;s engine
and he studied it. He found what he thought
defects. He groped steadily on&mdash;now seeing a
light&mdash;again thrown into darkness&mdash;now following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
what turned out to be a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp&mdash;again
getting hold of an idea that seemed to him
a gem.</p>

<p>There came to him gradually dawning thoughts.
First, that of Latent Heat. Again, that a small
quantity of water in the shape of steam heats a
large quantity of cold water. Yet, again, that
at 212 water is elastic, and that steam heats
six times the weight of cold water to a temperature
of 212, the temperature of steam.</p>

<p>And so he went on step by step, till one day
the thing burst on him, full-fledged, as it were&mdash;complete,
dazzling, a perfect inspiration.</p>

<p>It was a Sunday afternoon in the spring of
1765. He was taking a stroll in a quiet part of
Glasgow, now a paved and busy thoroughfare
called the Green. A Sunday calm brooded over
what was on weekdays a scene of busy life&mdash;of
washing and drying clothes. His thoughts,
as usual, hovered about his beloved theme. It
inspired him with a very passion as a child of
his own. The key to his engine&mdash;long sought&mdash;suddenly
flashed before his mind&rsquo;s eye. The
thing had been waiting incomplete for want of
it. It came to him then&mdash;the idea of a Separate
Condenser.</p>

<p>A great uprising of his mind followed. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
his solitary walk the flashing thought filled the
man with rapture.</p>

<p>Two drawbacks&mdash;waste of steam and waste of
fuel&mdash;had been the ruin of former inventions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye need not fash yourself about that, man,&rdquo;
Watt said to a friend, answering some objection
that he had made, &ldquo;I have now made an engine
that shall not waste a particle of steam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so, though it was but the beginning,
though years of weary labour and disappointment
and discouragement waited him before
the end was reached, the Condensing Steam
Engine, as we have it now, first sprang into
being that spring afternoon on the Green in
Glasgow.</p>

<p>And now the young inventor set himself with
eager enthusiasm to make a model. There were
no skilled workmen to be had, no self-acting
tools, as in our day, and so the first model was
only partly successful. But not a whit discouraged,
he went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My whole thoughts are bent on this machine,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I can think of nothing else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now there remains but to tell in a few
words&mdash;for it is the record of his manhood&mdash;the
&ldquo;ups and downs&rdquo; just beginning, the disappointments,
the failures, the hopes and fears that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
waited on this offspring of his brain. He was
poor, and money was the first thing that was
needed. Who would risk thousands on such a
vague and shadowy thing?</p>

<p>Meantime the pot had to be kept boiling!
He looked into the future, and he saw great
things steam might yet be made to do, but
there was bread and butter needed for the
present. So he went bravely in for surveying,
though there was little enough to be made
by that. He had still ill-health to struggle
against. &ldquo;I am still plagued with headaches,&rdquo;
he wrote about this time, &ldquo;and sometimes heartaches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But after a time a gleam of hope shone through
the clouds. After failures and difficulties he at
last succeeded in finding someone willing to risk
his money. So in 1769 he patented his engine,
and began to build it. In six months it was
finished, and as it neared completion Watt
could hardly sleep. Then, and for long still
in the future, he was to suffer from bad, incapable
workmen, and this accounted for his
partial failure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a clumsy job.&rdquo; Watt
grew depressed.</p>

<p>In 1770 he wrote: &ldquo;I enter on my thirty-fifth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
year, and I think I have hardly yet done
thirty-five pence worth of good in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A friend, seeing him cast down and unhappy,
advised him to give up inventing. As well
might he have advised the sun not to shine or
living man to cease from breathing. Meantime
the years went on. Watt was often, as he said,
&ldquo;heart-sick.&rdquo; Long years after, remembering
this weary time, he said, &ldquo;The public only look
at my success.&rdquo; He stinted himself in everything
but bare necessaries, for as yet his engine
had paid him nothing and cost enormously. But
light again arose in the darkness when he got
as a partner Boulton, of Birmingham, and from
that day onwards matters mended. Six of the
fourteen years&rsquo; patent were gone, but he succeeded
in getting a renewal of it for twenty-four
years by Act of Parliament, in spite of grumbling
discontent of men who wanted to steal the fruit
of his brain, and were thus prevented.</p>

<p>Now he set to work in earnest. His first
engine was made to blow the bellows of ironworks.
His second to pump water out of the
mines in Cornwall. In 1776 this was set up,
and worked perfectly. &ldquo;There it was, &lsquo;forking
water&rsquo; as never engine before had been known
&lsquo;to fork.&rsquo;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;All the world are agape,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to see
what it can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And it did well. And now the &ldquo;voice of
the country was in its favour.&rdquo; So the first
step was taken. The others followed in quick
succession. The partners worked together perfectly.
Watt understood engines, but not men.
He grew impatient, irritable, peevish if a workman
were inefficient, and would have dismissed
him on the spot. Boulton was wiser, and never
failed to oil the wheels. Watt was despondent,
easily cast down; Boulton was his &ldquo;backbone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There came then into Watt&rsquo;s mind the idea
of an engine that would produce <em>rotary</em> motion.
This he patented in 1781. All round and about,
ready to pounce on it, were a perfect swarm of
pirates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One&rsquo;s thoughts seem to be stolen before one
speaks them,&rdquo; he said. And again, &ldquo;All mankind
seem to be resolved to rob us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1782 the first rotary machine worked.
After long waiting there was a brilliant result.
It was made to drive a corn-mill. In our day
it would be hard to say what Watt&rsquo;s rotary
machine is not made to do. It is made for
corn-mills and for cotton-mills, for sugar-mills
and iron-mills. It drives our steamers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
rolls our hammer-iron and coins our money
and prints our books.</p>

<p>And now the great inventor had reached the
highest pinnacle of fame. In 1790 he had an
interview with the King, who asked about his
engines.</p>

<p>But he had not landed at the topmost round
of the ladder without much painful climbing
and many weary steps. His life had been all
through shadowed by ill-health, and an anxious,
worrying mind that refused to be calm. He
had a shrinking distaste to business, and a
fearful habit of looking on the dark side of
things. Often would he have sunk in depression
and despair had it not been for his cheery
partner. It was only in the late years of his
life that he came to know anything like peace.
His mind all along had been too active for his
body.</p>

<p>But though as an old man he retired from
public life and from business, he could not
altogether retire from invention. He invented
a letter-copying machine, and one for copying
statuary. In his old age he lived very quietly
in his comfortable house near Birmingham, furnishing
what he called his Garret, a room where
he might be alone and still invent, don again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
as in boyhood, the leather apron, cook his own
food, and ponder anew the details of those
wonderful inventions he had given to the world.</p>

<p>Friends admitted there found &ldquo;the great Mr.
Watt&rdquo; simple, modest, careless of display&mdash;much
as he had been as a boy&mdash;his voice low
and kindly, with still its broad, homely Scottish
accent. The world would have liked to draw
him from his seclusion, to caress him, to make
much of him. It offered him a baronetcy, but
his simple tastes lay not at all in the direction
of such honours, and he refused it.</p>

<p>In 1819, when he was eighty-three, the end
came. &ldquo;I feel,&rdquo; said the great man with a calm
in strange contrast to the fearfulness and timidity
that had accompanied him through life, &ldquo;I feel
that I am now come to my last illness.&rdquo; He
passed away quietly and without suffering.
They buried him in Handsworth Church&mdash;near
to his partner, Boulton&mdash;and erected an imposing
statue in Westminster Abbey, and beneath
it Lord Brougham wrote his famous epitaph.</p>

<p>To us his life has much of pathos. Men have
called him &ldquo;the greatest inventor in all ages,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the most extraordinary man that the world
has ever seen,&rdquo; but the long years of struggle
and labour and waiting, the weakness of body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and the oft depression of spirit, are to us not a
little sad, specially when we remember how
patiently he endured, how uncomplainingly he
suffered, that we might profit, that he might,
as Lord Brougham has it, &ldquo;increase the power
of man.&rdquo;</p>

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
